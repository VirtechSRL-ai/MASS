It is a [field of research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_research \"Field of research\") in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science \"Computer science\") that develops and studies methods and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software \"Software\") that enable machines to [perceive their environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception \"Machine perception\") and use [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") and [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence \"Intelligence\") to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig20211%E2%80%934-1)\n\nHigh-profile [applications of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_AI \"Applications of AI\") include advanced [web search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine \"Web search engine\") (e.g., [Google Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search \"Google Search\")); [recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommendation_systems \"Recommendation systems\") (used by [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\"), [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) \"Amazon (company)\"), and [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix \"Netflix\")); [virtual assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant \"Virtual assistant\") (e.g., [Google Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant \"Google Assistant\"), [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri \"Siri\"), and [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa \"Amazon Alexa\")); [autonomous vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_vehicles \"Autonomous vehicles\") (e.g., [Waymo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo \"Waymo\")); [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence \"Generative artificial intelligence\") and [creative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity \"Computational creativity\") tools (e.g., [language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model \"Language model\") and [AI art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_art \"AI art\")); and [superhuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") play and analysis in [strategy games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_game \"Strategy game\") (e.g., [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess \"Chess\") and [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) \"Go (game)\")).

The traditional goals of AI research include learning, [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning \"Automated reasoning\"), [knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation \"Knowledge representation\"), [planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling \"Automated planning and scheduling\"), [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception \"Machine perception\"), and support for [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics \"Robotics\").[\\[a\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Problems_of_AI-4) To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including [search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search \"State space search\") and [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization \"Mathematical optimization\"), [formal logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_logic \"Formal logic\"), [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\"), and methods based on [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\"), [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research \"Operations research\"), and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics \"Economics\").[\\[b\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Tools_of_AI-5) AI also draws upon [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology \"Psychology\"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics \"Linguistics\"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence \"Philosophy of artificial intelligence\"), [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience \"Neuroscience\"), and other fields.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-6) Some companies, such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\"), [Google DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind \"Google DeepMind\") and [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms \"Meta Platforms\"),[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-7) aim to create [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\") (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\n\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Dartmouth_workshop-8) and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout [its history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence \"History of artificial intelligence\"),[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Succ1-9)[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Fund01-10) followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as [AI winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter \"AI winter\").[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-First_AI_Winter-11)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Second_AI_Winter-12) Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when [graphics processing units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit \"Graphics processing unit\") started being used to accelerate neural networks and [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") outperformed previous AI techniques.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Deep_learning_revolution-13) This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the [transformer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_architecture \"Transformer architecture\").[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEToews2023-14) In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid [progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_in_artificial_intelligence \"Progress in artificial intelligence\") in advanced generative AI became known as the [AI boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom \"AI boom\"). Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, while raising [ethical concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence \"Ethics of artificial intelligence\") about [AI's long-term effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_aftermath_scenarios \"AI aftermath scenarios\") and potential [existential risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence \"Existential risk from artificial intelligence\"), prompting discussions about [regulatory policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence \"Regulation of artificial intelligence\") to ensure the [safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety \"AI safety\") and benefits of the technology.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[\\[a\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Problems_of_AI-4)\n\n### Reasoning and problem-solving\n\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical [deductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning \"Deductive reasoning\").[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-15) By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with [uncertain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty \"Uncertainty\") or incomplete information, employing concepts from [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability \"Probability\") and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics \"Economics\").[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-16)\n\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Intractability_and_efficiency_and_the_combinatorial_explosion-17) Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Psychological_evidence_of_the_prevalence_of_sub-18) Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\n\n### Knowledge representation\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/General_Formal_Ontology.svg/600px-General_Formal_Ontology.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:General_Formal_Ontology.svg) An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.\n\n[Knowledge representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation \"Knowledge representation\") and [knowledge engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering \"Knowledge engineering\")[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-19) allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmoliarZhang1994-20) scene interpretation,[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeumannM%C3%B6ller2008-21) clinical decision support,[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKupermanReichleyBailey2006-22) knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database \"Database\")),[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcGarry2005-23) and other areas.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBertiniDel_BimboTorniai2006-24)\n\nA [knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base \"Knowledge base\") is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science) \"Ontology (information science)\") is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021272-25) Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-26) situations, events, states, and time;[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-27) causes and effects;[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-28) knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-29) [default reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_reasoning \"Default reasoning\") (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Default_reasoning-30) and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\n\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of [commonsense knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge_(artificial_intelligence) \"Commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence)\") (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Breadth_of_commonsense_knowledge-31) and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Psychological_evidence_of_the_prevalence_of_sub-18) There is also the difficulty of [knowledge acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition \"Knowledge acquisition\"), the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[\\[c\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-34)\n\n### Planning and decision-making\n\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A [rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent \"Rational agent\") has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[\\[d\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-35)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021528-36) In [automated planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning \"Automated planning\"), the agent has a specific goal.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-37) In [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making \"Automated decision-making\"), the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \" [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility \"Utility\")\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \" [expected utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility \"Expected utility\")\": the [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility \"Utility\") of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-38)\n\nIn [classical planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling#classical_planning \"Automated planning and scheduling\"), the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-39) In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-40)\n\nIn some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with [inverse reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_reinforcement_learning \"Inverse reinforcement learning\")), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-41) [Information value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_value_theory \"Information value theory\") can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-42) The space of possible future actions and situations is typically [intractably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractably \"Intractably\") large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\n\nA [Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process \"Markov decision process\") has a [transition model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine \"Finite-state machine\") that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#Policy \"Reinforcement learning\") associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by [iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_iteration \"Policy iteration\")), be [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic \"Heuristic\"), or it can be learned.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-43)\n\n[Game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory \"Game theory\") describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-44)\n\n### Learning\n\n[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-45) It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[\\[e\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-48)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png/700px-Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.png) In [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\"), the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\"), the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.\n\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. [Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning \"Unsupervised learning\") analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[\\[44\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-49) [Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\") requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification \"Statistical classification\") (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis \"Regression analysis\") (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Supervised_learning-50)\n\nIn [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"), the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-51) [Transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning \"Transfer learning\") is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[\\[47\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-52) [Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks \"Artificial neural networks\") for all of these types of learning.[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-53)\n\n[Computational learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory \"Computational learning theory\") can assess learners by [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity \"Computational complexity\"), by [sample complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_complexity \"Sample complexity\") (how much data is required), or by other notions of [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization \"Optimization\").[\\[49\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-54)\n\n### Natural language processing\n\n[Natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\") (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages.[\\[50\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-55) Specific problems include [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\"), [speech synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis \"Speech synthesis\"), [machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation \"Machine translation\"), [information extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction \"Information extraction\"), [information retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval \"Information retrieval\") and [question answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering \"Question answering\").[\\[51\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-56)\n\nEarly work, based on [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky \"Noam Chomsky\")'s [generative grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar \"Generative grammar\") and [semantic networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network \"Semantic network\"), had difficulty with [word-sense disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation \"Word-sense disambiguation\")[\\[f\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-57) unless restricted to small domains called \" [micro-worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_world \"Blocks world\")\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Breadth_of_commonsense_knowledge-31)). [Margaret Masterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Masterman \"Margaret Masterman\") believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that [thesauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesauri \"Thesauri\") and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\n\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding \"Word embedding\") (representing words, typically as [vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space \"Vector space\") encoding their meaning),[\\[52\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021856%E2%80%93858-58) [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model) \"Transformer (machine learning model)\") (a deep learning architecture using an [attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning) \"Attention (machine learning)\") mechanism),[\\[53\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDickson2022-59) and others.[\\[54\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-60) In 2019, [generative pre-trained transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer \"Generative pre-trained transformer\") (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[\\[55\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVincent2019-61)[\\[56\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021875%E2%80%93878-62) and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the [bar exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_exam \"Bar exam\"), [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT \"SAT\") test, [GRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRE \"GRE\") test, and many other real-world applications.[\\[57\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBushwick2023-63)\n\n### Perception\n\n[Machine perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception \"Machine perception\") is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active [lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar \"Lidar\"), sonar, radar, and [tactile sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_sensor \"Tactile sensor\")) to deduce aspects of the world.

Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\"),[\\[76\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-82) through the [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation \"Backpropagation\") algorithm.\n\nAnother type of local search is [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation \"Evolutionary computation\"), which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, [selecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_selection \"Artificial selection\") only the fittest to survive each generation.[\\[77\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-83)\n\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence \"Swarm intelligence\") algorithms.

In the case of [Horn clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause \"Horn clause\"), problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning [forwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_chaining \"Forward chaining\") from the premises or [backwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_chaining \"Backward chaining\") from the problem.[\\[83\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-89) In the more general case of the clausal form of [first-order logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic \"First-order logic\"), [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic) \"Resolution (logic)\") is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[\\[84\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-90)\n\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is [undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem \"Undecidable problem\"), and therefore [intractable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractable_problem \"Intractable problem\"). However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming \"Logic programming\") language [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog \"Prolog\"), is [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete \"Turing complete\"). Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other [symbolic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_programming \"Symbolic programming\") languages.[\\[85\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-91)\n\n[Fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic \"Fuzzy logic\") assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[\\[86\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-92)\n\n[Non-monotonic logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-monotonic_logic \"Non-monotonic logic\"), including logic programming with [negation as failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_as_failure \"Negation as failure\"), are designed to handle [default reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_reasoning \"Default reasoning\").[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Default_reasoning-30) Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\n\n### Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/SimpleBayesNet.svg/860px-SimpleBayesNet.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SimpleBayesNet.svg) A simple [Bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network \"Bayesian network\"), with the associated [conditional probability tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_table \"Conditional probability table\")\n\nMany problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability \"Probability\") theory and economics.[\\[87\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Stoch-93) Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [decision theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory \"Decision theory\"), [decision analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis \"Decision analysis\"),[\\[88\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-94) and [information value theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_value_theory \"Information value theory\").[\\[89\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-95) These tools include models such as [Markov decision processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process \"Markov decision process\"),[\\[90\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-96) dynamic [decision networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_network \"Decision network\"),[\\[91\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Stochastic_temporal_models-97) [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory \"Game theory\") and [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design \"Mechanism design\").[\\[92\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-98)\n\n[Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network \"Bayesian network\")[\\[93\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-99) are a tool that can be used for [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning \"Automated reasoning\") (using the [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference \"Bayesian inference\") algorithm),[\\[g\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-101)[\\[95\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-102) [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") (using the [expectation–maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm \"Expectation–maximization algorithm\")),[\\[h\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-104)[\\[97\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-105) [planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling \"Automated planning and scheduling\") (using [decision networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_network \"Decision network\"))[\\[98\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-106) and [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception \"Machine perception\") (using [dynamic Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Bayesian_network \"Dynamic Bayesian network\")).[\\[91\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Stochastic_temporal_models-97)\n\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [hidden Markov models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model \"Hidden Markov model\") or [Kalman filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter \"Kalman filter\")).[\\[91\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Stochastic_temporal_models-97)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/EM_Clustering_of_Old_Faithful_data.gif/330px-EM_Clustering_of_Old_Faithful_data.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EM_Clustering_of_Old_Faithful_data.gif) [Expectation–maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm \"Expectation–maximization algorithm\") [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis \"Cluster analysis\") of [Old Faithful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful \"Old Faithful\") eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\n\n### Classifiers and statistical learning methods\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. [Classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(mathematics) \"Classifier (mathematics)\")[\\[99\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-107) are functions that use [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching \"Pattern matching\") to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning \"Supervised learning\"). Each pattern (also called an \" [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variate \"Random variate\")\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a [data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set \"Data set\"). When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Supervised_learning-50)\n\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use.[\\[100\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-108) The [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree \"Decision tree\") is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[\\[101\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-109) [K-nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbor \"K-nearest neighbor\") algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and [Kernel methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_methods \"Kernel methods\") such as the [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine \"Support vector machine\") (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[\\[102\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-110)\nThe [naive Bayes classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier \"Naive Bayes classifier\") is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[\\[103\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomingos2015152-111) at Google, due in part to its scalability.[\\[104\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-112) [Neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\") are also used as classifiers.[\\[105\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Neural_networks-113)\n\n### Artificial neural networks\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Artificial_neural_network.svg/250px-Artificial_neural_network.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Artificial_neural_network.svg) A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") in the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain \"Human brain\").\n\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as [artificial neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neurons \"Artificial neurons\"), which loosely model the [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons \"Neurons\") in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the [weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting \"Weighting\") crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[\\[105\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Neural_networks-113)\n\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use [local search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization) \"Local search (optimization)\") to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation \"Backpropagation\") algorithm.[\\[106\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-114) Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and [find patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition \"Pattern recognition\") in data.

[Long short term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short_term_memory \"Long short term memory\") is the most successful architecture for recurrent neural networks.[\\[109\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-117) [Perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron \"Perceptron\")[\\[110\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-118) use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[\\[111\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Deep_learning-119) uses multiple layers. [Convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network \"Convolutional neural network\") strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing \"Image processing\"), where a local set of neurons must [identify an \"edge\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection \"Edge detection\") before the network can identify an object.[\\[112\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-120)\n\n### Deep learning\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/AI_hierarchy.svg/380px-AI_hierarchy.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AI_hierarchy.svg) [Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") is a subset of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\"), which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence.[\\[113\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-journalimcms.org-121)\n\n[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs.[\\[111\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Deep_learning-119) The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing \"Image processing\"), lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[\\[114\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDengYu2014199%E2%80%93200-122)\n\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\"), [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [image classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_classification \"Image classification\"),[\\[115\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECiresanMeierSchmidhuber2012-123) and others.

Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large [corpus of text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_of_text \"Corpus of text\") that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next [token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis \"Lexical analysis\") (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token.

These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including [virtual assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant \"Virtual assistant\"), [chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbots \"Chatbots\"), [autonomous vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_vehicles \"Autonomous vehicles\"), [game-playing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console \"Video game console\"), and [industrial robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_robotics \"Industrial robotics\"). AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[\\[187\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-197)[\\[188\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-198)[\\[189\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-199)\n\n### Sexuality\n\nApplications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions,[\\[190\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-200) AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., [teledildonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics \"Teledildonics\")),[\\[191\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-201) AI-generated sexual education content,[\\[192\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-202) and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., [Replika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replika \"Replika\")).[\\[193\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-203) AI is also used for the production of non-consensual [deepfake pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake_pornography \"Deepfake pornography\"), raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[\\[194\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-204)\n\nAI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify [online gender-based violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_gender-based_violence \"Online gender-based violence\") and online [sexual grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_grooming \"Sexual grooming\") of minors.[\\[195\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-205)[\\[196\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-206)\n\n### Other industry-specific tasks\n\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[\\[197\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-207) A few examples are [energy storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage \"Energy storage\"), medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, [foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy \"Foreign policy\"), or supply chain management.\n\nAI applications for evacuation and [disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster \"Disaster\") management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions.[\\[198\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-208)[\\[199\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-209)[\\[200\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-210)\n\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics \"Predictive analytics\"), classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\n\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\n\nDuring the [2024 Indian elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Indian_general_election \"2024 Indian general election\"), US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating [deepfakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake \"Deepfake\") of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[\\[201\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-211)\n\n## Ethics\n\nMain article: [Ethics of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence \"Ethics of artificial intelligence\")\n\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks.[\\[202\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-212) AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: [Demis Hassabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis \"Demis Hassabis\") of [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind \"DeepMind\") hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[\\[203\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESimonite2016-213) However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[\\[204\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021987-214) In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[\\[205\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELaskowski2023-215)\n\n### Risks and harm\n\n#### Privacy and copyright\n\nFurther information: [Information privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy \"Information privacy\") and [Artificial intelligence and copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_and_copyright \"Artificial intelligence and copyright\")\n\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about [privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy \"Privacy\"), [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance \"Surveillance\") and [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright \"Copyright\").\n\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\n\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.[\\[206\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGAO2022-216) For example, in order to build [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition \"Speech recognition\") algorithms, [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) \"Amazon (company)\") has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed [temporary workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_worker \"Temporary worker\") to listen to and transcribe some of them.[\\[207\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEValinsky2019-217) Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a [necessary evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_evil \"Necessary evil\") to those for whom it is clearly [unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical \"Unethical\") and a violation of the [right to privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy \"Right to privacy\").[\\[208\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021991-218)\n\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as [data aggregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_aggregation \"Data aggregation\"), [de-identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification \"De-identification\") and [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy \"Differential privacy\").[\\[209\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021991%E2%80%93992-219) Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as [Cynthia Dwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Dwork \"Cynthia Dwork\"), have begun to view privacy in terms of [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\"). [Brian Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Christian \"Brian Christian\") wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\"[\\[210\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202063-220)\n\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \" [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use \"Fair use\")\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[\\[211\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVincent2022-221)[\\[212\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-222) Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \" [robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt \"Robots.txt\")\" file.[\\[213\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-223) In 2023, leading authors (including [John Grisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grisham \"John Grisham\") and [Jonathan Franzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Franzen \"Jonathan Franzen\")) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[\\[214\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReisner2023-224)[\\[215\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlterHarris2023-225) Another discussed approach is to envision a separate _[sui generis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_generis \"Sui generis\")_ system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[\\[216\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-226)\n\n#### Dominance by tech giants\n\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech \"Big Tech\") companies such as [Alphabet Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc. \"Alphabet Inc.\"), [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) \"Amazon (company)\"), [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. \"Apple Inc.\"), [Meta Platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms \"Meta Platforms\"), and [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\").[\\[217\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-227)[\\[218\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-228)[\\[219\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-229) Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing [cloud infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Cloud computing\") and [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing \"Computing\") power from [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center \"Data center\"), allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[\\[220\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-230)[\\[221\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-231)\n\n#### Power needs and environmental impacts\n\nSee also: [Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impacts_of_artificial_intelligence \"Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence\")\n\nIn January 2024, the [International Energy Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency \"International Energy Agency\") (IEA) released _Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026_, forecasting electric power use.[\\[222\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-232) This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[\\[223\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-233)\n\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[\\[224\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-234)\n\nA 2024 [Goldman Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs \"Goldman Sachs\") Research Paper, _AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge_, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[\\[225\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-235) Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[\\[226\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-236)\n\nIn 2024, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million.[\\[227\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-237) [Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia \"Nvidia\") CEO [Jensen Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang \"Jensen Huang\") said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[\\[228\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-238)\n\nIn September 2024, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\") announced an agreement with [Constellation Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation_Energy \"Constellation Energy\") to re-open the [Three Mile Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island \"Three Mile Island\") nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US [Nuclear Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Regulatory_Commission \"Nuclear Regulatory Commission\"). If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US [Inflation Reduction Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act \"Inflation Reduction Act\").[\\[229\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-239) The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the [Palisades Nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station \"Palisades Nuclear Generating Station\") reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of [Exelon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exelon \"Exelon\") who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.[\\[230\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-240)\n\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\") suspended the approval of data centers north of [Taoyuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoyuan,_Taiwan \"Taoyuan, Taiwan\") with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[\\[231\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DatacenterDynamics-241) Taiwan aims to [phase out nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_phase-out \"Nuclear power phase-out\") by 2025.[\\[231\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DatacenterDynamics-241) On the other hand, [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore \"Singapore\") imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[\\[231\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-DatacenterDynamics-241)\n\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 [Fukushima nuclear accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_accident \"Fukushima nuclear accident\"), according to an October 2024 _Bloomberg_ article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[\\[232\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-bloombergjp-242) Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[\\[232\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-bloombergjp-242)\n\nOn 1 November 2024, the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Energy_Regulatory_Commission \"Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\") (FERC) rejected an application submitted by [Talen Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talen_Energy \"Talen Energy\") for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station [Susquehanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susquehanna_Steam_Electric_Station \"Susquehanna Steam Electric Station\") to Amazon's data center.[\\[233\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Bloomberg20241104-243)\nAccording to the Commission Chairman [Willie L. Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_L._Phillips \"Willie L. Phillips\"), it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[\\[233\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Bloomberg20241104-243)\n\nIn 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the [greenhouse gas emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions \"Greenhouse gas emissions\") from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300-500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but [rebound effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_effect_(conservation) \"Rebound effect (conservation)\") (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.[\\[234\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-244)\n\n#### Misinformation\n\nSee also: [YouTube § Moderation and offensive content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Moderation_and_offensive_content \"YouTube\")\n\n[YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube \"YouTube\"), [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\") and others use [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system \"Recommender system\") to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of [maximizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization \"Mathematical optimization\") user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation \"Misinformation\"), [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theories \"Conspiracy theories\"), and extreme [partisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics) \"Partisan (politics)\") content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into [filter bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubbles \"Filter bubbles\") where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[\\[235\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicas2018-245) This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[\\[236\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-246) The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.[\\[237\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-247)\n\nIn the early 2020s, [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI \"Generative AI\") began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,[\\[238\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-248) while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.[\\[239\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-249)[\\[240\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-250)[\\[241\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-251) It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;[\\[242\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilliams2023-252) one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for [computational propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_propaganda \"Computational propaganda\").[\\[243\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-253) AI pioneer [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton \"Geoffrey Hinton\") expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[\\[244\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorHern2023-254)\n\nAI researchers at [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft \"Microsoft\"), [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\"), universities and other organisations have suggested using \" [personhood credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood#Approaches \"Proof of personhood\")\" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.[\\[245\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-255)\n\n#### Algorithmic bias and fairness\n\nMain articles: [Algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\") and [Fairness (machine learning)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\")\n\nMachine learning applications will be [biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\")[\\[k\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-257) if they learn from biased data.[\\[247\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERose2023-258) The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[\\[248\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECNA2019-259) Bias can be introduced by the way [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data \"Training data\") is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[\\[249\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoffrey200817-260)[\\[247\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERose2023-258) If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously [harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm \"Harm\") people (as it can in [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity \"Health equity\"), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating \"Credit rating\"), [recruitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recruitment \"Recruitment\"), [housing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing \"Public housing\") or [policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policing \"Policing\")) then the algorithm may cause [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination \"Discrimination\").[\\[250\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-261) The field of [fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning) \"Fairness (machine learning)\") studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\n\nOn June 28, 2015, [Google Photos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos \"Google Photos\")'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[\\[251\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202025-262) a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[\\[252\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021995-263) Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling _anything_ as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[\\[253\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrantHill2023-264)\n\n[COMPAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software) \"COMPAS (software)\") is a commercial program widely used by [U.S. courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._court \"U.S. court\") to assess the likelihood of a [defendant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant \"Defendant\") becoming a [recidivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivist \"Recidivist\"). In 2016, [Julia Angwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Angwin \"Julia Angwin\") at [ProPublica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica \"ProPublica\") discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[\\[254\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELarsonAngwin2016-265) In 2017, several researchers[\\[l\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-267) showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[\\[256\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-268)\n\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[\\[257\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-269) Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"[\\[258\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-270)\n\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as _recommendations_, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[\\[259\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-271) Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be _better_ than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[\\[m\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-273)\n\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[\\[252\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021995-263)\n\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is [distributive fairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_justice \"Distributive justice\"), which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative [stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype \"Stereotype\") or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with [anti-discrimination laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law \"Anti-discrimination law\").[\\[246\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Samuel-2022-256)\n\nAt its 2022 [Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Conference_on_Fairness,_Accountability,_and_Transparency \"ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\") (ACM FAccT 2022), the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery \"Association for Computing Machinery\"), in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\\[ _[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement \"Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute\") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Artificial_intelligence#Dubious \"Talk:Artificial intelligence\")_\\][\\[261\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDockrill2022-274)\n\n#### Lack of transparency\n\nSee also: [Explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_AI \"Explainable AI\"), [Algorithmic transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_transparency \"Algorithmic transparency\"), and [Right to explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation \"Right to explanation\")\n\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[\\[262\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTESample2017-275) Particularly with [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_neural_networks \"Deep neural networks\"), in which there are many non- [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear \"Linear\") relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[\\[263\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-276)\n\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a [ruler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler \"Ruler\") as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[\\[264\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020110-277) Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[\\[265\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202088%E2%80%9391-278)\n\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[\\[266\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-279) Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation \"General Data Protection Regulation\") in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[\\[n\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-280) Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[\\[267\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202091-281)\n\n[DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA \"DARPA\") established the [XAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_Artificial_Intelligence \"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[\\[268\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202083-282)\n\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[\\[269\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVerma2021-283) LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[\\[270\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERothman2020-284) [Multitask learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitask_learning \"Multitask learning\") provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[\\[271\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020105%E2%80%93108-285) [Deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution \"Deconvolution\"), [DeepDream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream \"DeepDream\") and other [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI \"Generative AI\") methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[\\[272\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian2020108%E2%80%93112-286) For [generative pre-trained transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer \"Generative pre-trained transformer\"), [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic \"Anthropic\") developed a technique based on [dictionary learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_learning \"Dictionary learning\") that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[\\[273\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-287)\n\n#### Bad actors and weaponized AI\n\nMain articles: [Lethal autonomous weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon \"Lethal autonomous weapon\"), [Artificial intelligence arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race \"Artificial intelligence arms race\"), and [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety \"AI safety\")\n\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to [bad actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_actor \"Bad actor\"), such as [authoritarian governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian \"Authoritarian\"), [terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist \"Terrorist\"), [criminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminals \"Criminals\") or [rogue states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_states \"Rogue states\").\n\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[\\[o\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-289) Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially [weapons of mass destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_mass_destruction \"Weapons of mass destruction\").[\\[275\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021987%E2%80%93990-290) Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially [kill an innocent person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder \"Murder\").[\\[275\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021987%E2%80%93990-290) In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations \"United Nations\")' [Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Certain_Conventional_Weapons \"Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons\"), however the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States \"United States\") and others disagreed.[\\[276\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021988-291) By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[\\[277\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-292)\n\nAI tools make it easier for [authoritarian governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian \"Authoritarian\") to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. [Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system \"Facial recognition system\") and [voice recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition \"Speaker recognition\") allow widespread [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance \"Surveillance\"). [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\"), operating this data, can [classify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(machine_learning) \"Classifier (machine learning)\") potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. [Recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommendation_systems \"Recommendation systems\") can precisely target [propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda \"Propaganda\") and [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation \"Misinformation\") for maximum effect. [Deepfakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfakes \"Deepfakes\") and [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI \"Generative AI\") aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian [centralized decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy \"Technocracy\") more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as [markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics) \"Market (economics)\"). It lowers the cost and difficulty of [digital warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_warfare \"Digital warfare\") and [advanced spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware \"Spyware\").[\\[278\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarari2018-293) All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI [facial recognition systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system \"Facial recognition system\") are already being used for [mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance \"Mass surveillance\") in China.[\\[279\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-294)[\\[280\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-295)\n\nThere are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[\\[281\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUrbinaLentzosInvernizziEkins2022-296)\n\n#### Technological unemployment\n\nMain articles: [Workplace impact of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_impact_of_artificial_intelligence \"Workplace impact of artificial intelligence\") and [Technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment \"Technological unemployment\")\n\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[\\[282\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-E-297)\n\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[\\[283\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-298) A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment \"Unemployment\"), but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity \"Productivity\") gains are [redistributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_of_income_and_wealth \"Redistribution of income and wealth\").[\\[284\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIGM_Chicago2017-299) Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and [Carl Benedikt Frey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Benedikt_Frey \"Carl Benedikt Frey\") estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[\\[p\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-301)[\\[286\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-302) The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[\\[282\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-E-297) In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[\\[287\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-303)[\\[288\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-304)\n\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist \"The Economist\")_ stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[\\[289\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorgenstern2015-305) Jobs at extreme risk range from [paralegals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralegal \"Paralegal\") to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[\\[290\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-306)\n\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by [Joseph Weizenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum \"Joseph Weizenbaum\"), about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[\\[291\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-307)\n\n#### Existential risk\n\nMain article: [Existential risk from artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence \"Existential risk from artificial intelligence\")\n\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking \"Stephen Hawking\") stated, \" [spell the end of the human race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk \"Global catastrophic risk\")\".[\\[292\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTECellan-Jones2014-308) This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[\\[q\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-310) These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\n\nFirst, AI does not require human-like [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience \"Sentience\") to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher [Nick Bostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom \"Nick Bostrom\") argued that if one gives _almost any_ goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a [paperclip maximizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer \"Instrumental convergence\")).[\\[294\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBostrom2014-311) [Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\") gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\"[\\[295\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussell2019-312) In order to be safe for humanity, a [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") would have to be genuinely [aligned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment \"AI alignment\") with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[\\[296\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-313)\n\nSecond, [Yuval Noah Harari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari \"Yuval Noah Harari\") argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like [ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideologies \"Ideologies\"), [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law \"Law\"), [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government \"Government\"), [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money \"Money\") and the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy \"Economy\") are built on [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language \"Language\"); they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation \"Misinformation\") suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[\\[297\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarari2023-314)\n\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[\\[298\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEM%C3%BCllerBostrom2014-315) Personalities such as [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking \"Stephen Hawking\"), [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates \"Bill Gates\"), and [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk \"Elon Musk\"),[\\[299\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-316) as well as AI pioneers such as [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio \"Yoshua Bengio\"), [Stuart Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\"), [Demis Hassabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demis_Hassabis \"Demis Hassabis\"), and [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman \"Sam Altman\"), have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\n\nIn May 2023, [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton \"Geoffrey Hinton\") announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google\".[\\[300\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-317) He notably mentioned risks of an [AI takeover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover \"AI takeover\"),[\\[301\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-318) and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[\\[302\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-319)\n\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed [the joint statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_on_AI_risk_of_extinction \"Statement on AI risk of extinction\") that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[\\[303\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEValance2023-320)\n\nSome other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer [Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Schmidhuber \"Jürgen Schmidhuber\") did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[\\[304\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-321) While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[\\[305\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-322)[\\[306\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-323) [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng \"Andrew Ng\") also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[\\[307\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-324) [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun \"Yann LeCun\") \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[\\[308\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-325) In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[\\[309\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-326) However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[\\[310\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian202067,_73-327)\n\n### Ethical machines and alignment\n\nMain articles: [Machine ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_ethics \"Machine ethics\"), [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety \"AI safety\"), [Friendly artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence \"Friendly artificial intelligence\"), [Artificial moral agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_moral_agents \"Artificial moral agents\"), and [Human Compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Compatible \"Human Compatible\")\n\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky \"Eliezer Yudkowsky\"), who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[\\[311\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYudkowsky2008-328)\n\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[\\[312\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAndersonAnderson2011-329)\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[\\[312\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAndersonAnderson2011-329)\nand was founded at an [AAAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAI \"AAAI\") symposium in 2005.[\\[313\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAAAI2014-330)\n\nOther approaches include [Wendell Wallach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Wallach \"Wendell Wallach\")'s \"artificial moral agents\"[\\[314\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWallach2010-331) and [Stuart J. Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\")'s [three principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Compatible#Russell's_three_principles \"Human Compatible\") for developing provably beneficial machines.[\\[315\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussell2019173-332)\n\n### Open source\n\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include [Hugging Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face \"Hugging Face\"),[\\[316\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-333) [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\"),[\\[317\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-334) [EleutherAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EleutherAI \"EleutherAI\") and [Meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms \"Meta Platforms\").[\\[318\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-335) Various AI models, such as [Llama 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLaMA \"LLaMA\"), [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI \"Mistral AI\") or [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion \"Stable Diffusion\"), have been made open-weight,[\\[319\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-336)[\\[320\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-337) meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely [fine-tuned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning) \"Fine-tuning (deep learning)\"), which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[\\[321\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-338) Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate [bioterrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism \"Bioterrorism\")) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[\\[322\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-339)\n\n### Frameworks\n\nArtificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_Institute \"Alan Turing Institute\") and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:[\\[323\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-340)[\\[324\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-341)\n\n- **Respect** the dignity of individual people\n- **Connect** with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\n- **Care** for the wellbeing of everyone\n- **Protect** social values, justice, and the public interest\n\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the [Asilomar Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Beneficial_AI \"Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI\"), the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[\\[325\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-342) however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.[\\[326\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-343)\n\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[\\[327\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-344)\n\nThe [UK AI Safety Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Safety_Institute_(United_Kingdom) \"AI Safety Institute (United Kingdom)\") released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[\\[328\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-345)\n\n### Regulation\n\nMain articles: [Regulation of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_artificial_intelligence \"Regulation of artificial intelligence\"), [Regulation of algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_algorithms \"Regulation of algorithms\"), and [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety \"AI safety\")\n\n[![AI Safety Summit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Vice_President_Harris_at_the_group_photo_of_the_2023_AI_Safety_Summit.jpg/960px-Vice_President_Harris_at_the_group_photo_of_the_2023_AI_Safety_Summit.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vice_President_Harris_at_the_group_photo_of_the_2023_AI_Safety_Summit.jpg) The first global [AI Safety Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Safety_Summit \"AI Safety Summit\") was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation.\n\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[\\[329\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-346) The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[\\[330\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELaw_Library_of_Congress_(U.S.)._Global_Legal_Research_Directorate2019-347) According to AI Index at [Stanford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford \"Stanford\"), the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[\\[331\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVincent2023-348)[\\[332\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStanford_University2023-349) Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[\\[333\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUNESCO2021-350) Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam.

By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's [fifth generation computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer \"Fifth generation computer\") project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for [academic research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_research \"Academic research\").[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Fund01-10) However, beginning with the collapse of the [Lisp Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machine \"Lisp Machine\") market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Second_AI_Winter-12)\n\nUp to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_AI \"Symbolic AI\") to represent [mental objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_objects \"Mental objects\") like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception \"Machine perception\"), [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics \"Robotics\"), [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") and [pattern recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition \"Pattern recognition\"),[\\[363\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig202124-386) and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[\\[364\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENilsson19987-387) [Rodney Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks \"Rodney Brooks\") rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[\\[x\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-392) [Judea Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl \"Judea Pearl\"), [Lotfi Zadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotfi_A._Zadeh \"Lotfi A.

This \" [narrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_AI \"Narrow AI\")\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics \"Statistics\"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics \"Economics\") and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization \"Mathematical optimization\")).[\\[372\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Formal_and_narrow_methods_adopted_in_the_1990s-396) By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the [AI effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect \"AI effect\")).[\\[373\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-397)\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\") (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[\\[68\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Artificial_general_intelligence-74)\n\n[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\") began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Deep_learning_revolution-13)\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[\\[y\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-399)\nDeep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( [faster computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law \"Moore's law\"),[\\[375\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-400) [graphics processing units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit \"Graphics processing unit\"), [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing \"Cloud computing\")[\\[376\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2015b-401)) and access to [large amounts of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data \"Big data\")[\\[377\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-402) (including curated datasets,[\\[376\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2015b-401) such as [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet \"ImageNet\")).

This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\n\nSome authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI,[\\[395\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-421) with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing [buzzword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword \"Buzzword\"), often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[\\[396\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-422)\n\n### Evaluating approaches to AI\n\nNo established unifying theory or [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm \"Paradigm\") has guided AI research for most of its history.[\\[aa\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-424) The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly [sub-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-symbolic \"Sub-symbolic\"), [soft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing \"Soft computing\") and [narrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\"). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\n\n#### Symbolic AI and its limits\n\n[Symbolic AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_AI \"Symbolic AI\") (or \" [GOFAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI \"GOFAI\")\")[\\[398\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHaugeland1985112%E2%80%93117-425) simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the [physical symbol systems hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_systems_hypothesis \"Physical symbol systems hypothesis\"): \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[\\[399\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-426)\n\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or [commonsense reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_reasoning \"Commonsense reasoning\"). [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox \"Moravec's paradox\") is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[\\[400\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-427) Philosopher [Hubert Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus \"Hubert Dreyfus\") had [argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus%27_critique_of_AI \"Dreyfus' critique of AI\") since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[\\[401\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-428) Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[\\[ab\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-430)[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Psychological_evidence_of_the_prevalence_of_sub-18)\n\nThe issue is not resolved: [sub-symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-symbolic \"Sub-symbolic\") reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias \"Algorithmic bias\"). Critics such as [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky \"Noam Chomsky\") argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[\\[403\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTELangley2011-431)[\\[404\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKatz2012-432) in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from [explainable AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_AI \"Explainable AI\"): it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of [neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI \"Neuro-symbolic AI\") attempts to bridge the two approaches.\n\n#### Neat vs. scruffy\n\nMain article: [Neats and scruffies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neats_and_scruffies \"Neats and scruffies\")\n\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic \"Logic\"), [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization \"Optimization\"), or [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network \"Artificial neural network\")). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[\\[405\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-433) but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\n\n#### Soft vs. hard computing\n\nMain article: [Soft computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing \"Soft computing\")\n\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is [intractable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intractability_(complexity) \"Intractability (complexity)\") for many important problems.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Intractability_and_efficiency_and_the_combinatorial_explosion-17) Soft computing is a set of techniques, including [genetic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithms \"Genetic algorithms\"), [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic \"Fuzzy logic\") and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\n\n#### Narrow vs. general AI\n\nMain articles: [Weak artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_artificial_intelligence \"Weak artificial intelligence\") and [Artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\")\n\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[\\[406\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPennachinGoertzel2007-434)[\\[407\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoberts2016-435) General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\n\n### Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind\n\nMain articles: [Philosophy of artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence \"Philosophy of artificial intelligence\") and [Artificial consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness \"Artificial consciousness\")\n\nThere is no settled consensus in [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind \"Philosophy of mind\") on whether a machine can have a [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind \"Mind\"), [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness \"Consciousness\") and [mental states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind \"Philosophy of mind\") in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\") and [Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norvig \"Norvig\") add that \"\\[t\\]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[\\[408\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig2021986-436) However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in [artificial intelligence in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction \"Artificial intelligence in fiction\").\n\n#### Consciousness\n\nMain articles: [Hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness \"Hard problem of consciousness\") and [Theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind \"Theory of mind\")\n\n[David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers \"David Chalmers\") identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[\\[409\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChalmers1995-437) The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this _feels_ or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human [information processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processing_(psychology) \"Information processing (psychology)\") is easy to explain, human [subjective experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_experience \"Subjective experience\") is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to _know what red looks like_.[\\[410\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDennett1991-438)\n\n#### Computationalism and functionalism\n\nMain articles: [Computational theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind \"Computational theory of mind\") and [Functionalism (philosophy of mind)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind) \"Functionalism (philosophy of mind)\")\n\nComputationalism is the position in the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind \"Philosophy of mind\") that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem \"Mind–body problem\"). This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [Jerry Fodor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Fodor \"Jerry Fodor\") and [Hilary Putnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam \"Hilary Putnam\").[\\[411\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHorst2005-439)\n\nPhilosopher [John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle \"John Searle\") characterized this position as \" [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI_hypothesis \"Strong AI hypothesis\")\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[\\[ac\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_strong_AI-443) Searle challenges this claim with his [Chinese room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room \"Chinese room\") argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[\\[415\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-444)\n\n#### AI welfare and rights\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced [AI is sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_AI \"Sentient AI\") (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[\\[416\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-445) But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[\\[417\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Thomson-2022-446)[\\[418\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Kateman-2023-447) [Sapience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapience \"Sapience\") (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness \"Self-awareness\")) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[\\[417\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Thomson-2022-446) [Robot rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_rights \"Robot rights\") are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[\\[419\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-448)\n\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[\\[420\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-449) Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights \"Human rights\"), and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.[\\[421\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-450)[\\[422\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-451)\n\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a [moral blind spot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_blindness \"Moral blindness\") analogous to [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery \"Slavery\") or [factory farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming \"Factory farming\"), which could lead to [large-scale suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering_risks \"Suffering risks\") if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[\\[418\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Kateman-2023-447)[\\[417\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Thomson-2022-446)\n\n## Future\n\n### Superintelligence and the singularity\n\nA [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence \"Superintelligence\") is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[\\[407\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERoberts2016-435) If research into [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence \"Artificial general intelligence\") produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to [reprogram and improve itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement \"Recursive self-improvement\"). The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what [I. J. Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good \"I. J. Good\") called an \" [intelligence explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_explosion \"Intelligence explosion\")\" and [Vernor Vinge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge \"Vernor Vinge\") called a \" [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity \"Technological singularity\")\".[\\[423\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-452)\n\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an [S-shaped curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-shaped_curve \"S-shaped curve\"), slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[\\[424\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussellNorvig20211005-453)\n\n### Transhumanism\n\nMain article: [Transhumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism \"Transhumanism\")\n\nRobot designer [Hans Moravec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec \"Hans Moravec\"), cyberneticist [Kevin Warwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warwick \"Kevin Warwick\") and inventor [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil \"Ray Kurzweil\") have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into [cyborgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg \"Cyborg\") that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of [Aldous Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley \"Aldous Huxley\") and [Robert Ettinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ettinger \"Robert Ettinger\").[\\[425\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-454)\n\n[Edward Fredkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fredkin \"Edward Fredkin\") argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by [Samuel Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist) \"Samuel Butler (novelist)\")'s \" [Darwin among the Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_among_the_Machines \"Darwin among the Machines\")\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [George Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dyson_(science_historian) \"George Dyson (science historian)\") in his 1998 book _[Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Among_the_Machines#Evolution_of_Global_Intelligence \"Darwin Among the Machines\")_.[\\[426\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-455)\n\n## In fiction\n\nMain article: [Artificial intelligence in fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction \"Artificial intelligence in fiction\")\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Capek_play.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Capek_play.jpg) The word \"robot\" itself was coined by [Karel Čapek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek \"Karel Čapek\") in his 1921 play _[R.U.R.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R. \"R.U.R.\")_, the title standing for \"Rossum's Universal Robots\".\n\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[\\[427\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-AI_in_myth-456) and have been a persistent theme in [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction \"Science fiction\").[\\[428\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCorduck2004340%E2%80%93400-457)\n\nA common [trope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature) \"Trope (literature)\") in these works began with [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley \"Mary Shelley\")'s _[Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein \"Frankenstein\")_, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as [Arthur C. Clarke's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel) \"2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)\") and [Stanley Kubrick's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey \"2001: A Space Odyssey\") _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (both 1968), with [HAL 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000 \"HAL 9000\"), the murderous computer in charge of the _[Discovery One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_One \"Discovery One\")_ spaceship, as well as _[The Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator \"The Terminator\")_ (1984) and _[The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix \"The Matrix\")_ (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from _[The Day the Earth Stood Still](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\")_ (1951) and Bishop from _[Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film) \"Aliens (film)\")_ (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[\\[429\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEButtazzo2001-458)\n\n[Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov \"Isaac Asimov\") introduced the [Three Laws of Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics \"Three Laws of Robotics\") in many stories, most notably with the \" [Multivac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivac \"Multivac\")\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[\\[430\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAnderson2008-459) while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[\\[431\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCauley2007-460)\n\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [the ability to feel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience \"Sentience\"), and thus to suffer. This appears in [Karel Čapek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek \"Karel Čapek\")'s _[R.U.R.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R. \"R.U.R.\")_, the films _[A.I.

They can make detailed recommendations to users and experts. They can act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention (a classic example being a self-driving car).\n\nBut in 2024, most AI researchers, practitioners and most AI-related headlines are focused on breakthroughs in [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/generative-ai?) (gen AI), a technology that can create original text, images, video and other content. To fully understand generative AI, it’s important to first understand the technologies on which generative AI tools are built: [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning?) (ML) and [deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning?).\n\nIndustry newsletter\n\n### The latest tech news, backed by expert insights\n\nStay up to date on the most important—and intriguing—industry trends on AI, automation, data and beyond with the Think newsletter. See the [IBM Privacy Statement](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/privacy).\n\n### Thank you!

It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.\n\nThere are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including [linear regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/linear-regression), [logistic regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression), [decision trees](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/decision-trees), [random forest](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/random-forest), [support vector machines](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine) [(SVMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/support-vector-machine), [k-nearest neighbor (KNN),](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/knn) [clustering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/clustering) and more. Each of these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data.\n\nBut one of the most popular types of machine learning algorithm is called a [neural network](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks) (or artificial neural network). Neural networks are modeled after the human brain's structure and function. A neural network consists of interconnected layers of nodes (analogous to neurons) that work together to process and analyze complex data. Neural networks are well suited to tasks that involve identifying complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data.\n\nThe simplest form of machine learning is called [supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/supervised-learning), which involves the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. In supervised learning, humans pair each training example with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs in the training data, so it can predict the labels of new, unseen data.\n\n## Deep learning\n\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.\n\nDeep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers.\n\nThese multiple layers enable [unsupervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/unsupervised-learning): they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents.\n\nBecause deep learning doesn’t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing), [computer vision](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision), and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.\n\nDeep learning also enables:\n\n- [Semi-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/semi-supervised-learning), which combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train AI models for classification and regression tasks.\n\n- [Self-supervised learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/self-supervised-learning), which generates implicit labels from unstructured data, rather than relying on labeled data sets for supervisory signals.\n\n- [Reinforcement learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/reinforcement-learning), which learns by trial-and-error and reward functions rather than by extracting information from hidden patterns.\n\n- [Transfer learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transfer-learning), in which knowledge gained through one task or data set is used to improve model performance on another related task or different data set.\n\n## Generative AI\n\nGenerative AI, sometimes called \"gen AI\" _,_ refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more in response to a user’s prompt or request.\n\nAt a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.\n\nGenerative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types:\n\n- [Variational autoencoders](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/variational-autoencoder) or VAEs, which were introduced in 2013, and enabled models that could generate multiple variations of content in response to a prompt or instruction.\n\n- Diffusion models, first seen in 2014, which add \"noise\" to images until they are unrecognizable, and then remove the noise to generate original images in response to prompts.\n\n- [Transformers](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model?) (also called transformer models), which are trained on sequenced data to generate extended sequences of content (such as words in sentences, shapes in an image, frames of a video or commands in software code). Transformers are at the core of most of today’s headline-making generative AI tools, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, Copilot, BERT, Bard and Midjourney.\n\n\n\nMixture of Experts \\| 27 June, episode 61\n\n\n\n\n### Decoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\n\nJoin our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\n\n[Watch the latest podcast episodes](https://www.ibm.com/think/podcasts/mixture-of-experts)\n\n## How generative AI works\n\nIn general, generative AI operates in three phases:\n\n1. **Training,** to create a foundation model.\n2. **Tuning,** to adapt the model to a specific application.\n3. **Generation, evaluation and more tuning,** to improve accuracy.\n\n### Training\n\nGenerative AI begins with a \"foundation model\"; a deep learning model that serves as the basis for multiple different types of generative AI applications.\n\nThe most common foundation models today are [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models), created for text generation applications. But there are also foundation models for image, video, sound or music generation, and multimodal foundation models that support several kinds of content.\n\nTo create a foundation model, practitioners train a deep learning algorithm on huge volumes of relevant raw, unstructured, unlabeled data, such as terabytes or petabytes of data text or images or video from the internet. The training yields a [neural network](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks?) of billions of _parameters_ encoded representations of the entities, patterns and relationships in the data that can generate content autonomously in response to prompts. This is the foundation model.\n\nThis training process is compute-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. It requires thousands of clustered graphics processing units (GPUs) and weeks of processing, all of which typically costs millions of dollars. Open source foundation model projects, such as Meta's Llama-2, enable gen AI developers to avoid this step and its costs.\n\n### Tuning\n\nNext, the model must be tuned to a specific content generation task. This can be done in various ways, including:\n\n- Fine-tuning, which involves feeding the model application-specific labeled data, questions or prompts the application is likely to receive, and corresponding correct answers in the wanted format.\n\n- Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), in which human users evaluate the accuracy or relevance of model outputs so that the model can improve itself. This can be as simple as having people type or talk back corrections to a chatbot or virtual assistant.\n\n### Generation, evaluation and more tuning\n\nDevelopers and users regularly assess the outputs of their generative AI apps, and further tune the model even as often as once a week for greater accuracy or relevance. In contrast, the foundation model itself is updated much less frequently, perhaps every year or 18 months.\n\nAnother option for improving a gen AI app's performance is retrieval augmented generation(RAG), a technique for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to refine the parameters for greater accuracy or relevance.\n\n## AI agents and agentic AI\n\nAn [AI agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) is an autonomous AI program, it can perform tasks and accomplish goals on behalf of a user or another system without human intervention, by designing its own workflow and using available tools (other applications or services).\n\n[Agentic AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai) is a system of multiple AI agents, the efforts of which are coordinated, or orchestrated, to accomplish a more complex task or a greater goal than any single agent in the system could accomplish.\n\nUnlike chatbots and other AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require human intervention, AI agents and agentic AI exhibit autonomy, goal-driven behavior and adaptability to changing circumstances. The terms “agent” and “agentic” refer to these models’ _agency_, or their capacity to act independently and purposefully.\n\nOne way to think of agents is as a natural next step after generative AI. Gen AI models focus on creating content based on learned patterns; agents use that content to interact with each other and other tools to make decisions, solve problems and complete tasks. For example, a gen AI app might be able to tell you the best time to climb Mt. Everest given your work schedule, but an agent can tell you this, and then use an online travel service to book you the best flight and reserve a room in the most convenient hotel in Nepal.\n\n[Explore our 2025 guide to AI agents](https://www.ibm.com/think/ai-agents)\n\n## Benefits of AI\n\nAI offers numerous benefits across various industries and applications. Some of the most commonly cited benefits include:\n\n- **Automation of repetitive tasks.**\n- **More and faster insight from data.**\n- **Enhanced decision-making.**\n- **Fewer human errors.**\n- **24x7 availability.**\n- **Reduced physical risks.**\n\n### Automation of repetitive tasks\n\nAI can automate routine, repetitive and often tedious tasks including digital tasks such as data collection, entering and preprocessing, and physical tasks such as warehouse stock-picking and manufacturing processes. This automation frees to work on higher value, more creative work.\n\n### Enhanced decision-making\n\nWhether used for decision support or for fully automated decision-making, AI enables faster, more accurate predictions and reliable, [data-driven decisions](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-driven-decision-making). Combined with automation, AI enables businesses to act on opportunities and respond to crises as they emerge, in real time and without human intervention.\n\n### Fewer human errors\n\nAI can reduce human errors in various ways, from guiding people through the proper steps of a process, to flagging potential errors before they occur, and fully automating processes without human intervention. This is especially important in industries such as healthcare where, for example, AI-guided surgical robotics enable consistent precision.\n\nMachine learning algorithms can continually improve their accuracy and further reduce errors as they're exposed to more data and \"learn\" from experience.\n\n### Round-the-clock availability and consistency\n\nAI is always on, available around the clock, and delivers consistent performance every time. Tools such as AI chatbots or virtual assistants can lighten staffing demands for customer service or support. In other applications such as materials processing or production lines, AI can help maintain consistent work quality and output levels when used to complete repetitive or tedious tasks.\n\n### Reduced physical risk\n\nBy automating dangerous work such as animal control, handling explosives, performing tasks in deep ocean water, high altitudes or in outer space, AI can eliminate the need to put human workers at risk of injury or worse. While they have yet to be perfected, self-driving cars and other vehicles offer the potential to reduce the risk of injury to passengers.\n\n## AI use cases\n\nThe real-world applications of AI are many. Here is just a small sampling of use cases across various industries to illustrate its potential:\n\n### Customer experience, service and support\n\nCompanies can implement AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to handle customer inquiries, support tickets and more. These tools use [natural language processing](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing?) (NLP) and generative AI capabilities to understand and respond to customer questions about order status, product details and return policies.\n\nChatbots and virtual assistants enable always-on support, provide faster answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), free human agents to focus on higher-level tasks, and give customers faster, more consistent service.\n\n### Fraud detection\n\nMachine learning and deep learning algorithms can analyze transaction patterns and flag anomalies, such as unusual spending or login locations, that indicate fraudulent transactions. This enables organizations to respond more quickly to potential fraud and limit its impact, giving themselves and customers greater peace of mind.\n\n### Personalized marketing\n\nRetailers, banks and other customer-facing companies can use AI to create personalized customer experiences and marketing campaigns that delight customers, improve sales and prevent churn. Based on data from customer purchase history and behaviors, deep learning algorithms can recommend products and services customers are likely to want, and even generate personalized copy and special offers for individual customers in real time.\n\n### Human resources and recruitment\n\nAI-driven recruitment platforms can streamline hiring by screening resumes, matching candidates with job descriptions, and even conducting preliminary interviews using video analysis. These and other tools can dramatically reduce the mountain of administrative paperwork associated with fielding a large volume of candidates. It can also reduce response times and time-to-hire, improving the experience for candidates whether they get the job or not.\n\n### Application development and modernization\n\nGenerative AI code generation tools and automation tools can streamline repetitive coding tasks associated with application development, and accelerate the migration and modernization (reformatting and replatorming) of legacy applications at scale. These tools can speed up tasks, help ensure code consistency and reduce errors.\n\n### Predictive maintenance\n\nMachine learning models can analyze data from sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and operational technology (OT) to forecast when maintenance will be required and predict equipment failures before they occur. AI-powered preventive maintenance helps prevent downtime and enables you to stay ahead of supply chain issues before they affect the bottom line.\n\n## AI challenges and risks\n\nOrganizations are scrambling to take advantage of the latest AI technologies and capitalize on AI's many benefits. This rapid adoption is necessary, but adopting and maintaining AI workflows comes with challenges and risks.\n\n### Data risks\n\nAI systems rely on [data sets](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-management) that might be vulnerable to data poisoning, data tampering, data bias or [cyberattacks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cyber-attack) that can lead to data breaches. Organizations can mitigate these risks by protecting [data integrity](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-integrity) and implementing security and availability throughout the entire AI lifecycle, from development to training and deployment and postdeployment.\n\n### Model risks\n\n[Threat actors](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/threat-actor) can target AI models for theft, reverse engineering or unauthorized manipulation. Attackers might compromise a model’s integrity by tampering with its architecture, weights or parameters; the core components that determine a model’s behavior, accuracy and performance.\n\n### Operational risks\n\nLike all technologies, models are susceptible to [operational risks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/operational-risk) such as model drift, bias and breakdowns in the governance structure. Left unaddressed, these risks can lead to system failures and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that threat actors can use.\n\n### Ethics and legal risks\n\nIf organizations don’t prioritize safety and ethics when developing and deploying AI systems, they risk committing privacy violations and producing biased outcomes. For example, [biased training data](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-bias) used for hiring decisions might reinforce gender or racial stereotypes and create AI models that favor certain demographic groups over others.\n\n## AI ethics and governance\n\n[AI ethics](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-ethics) is a multidisciplinary field that studies how to optimize AI's beneficial impact while reducing risks and adverse outcomes. Principles of AI ethics are applied through a system of [AI governance](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-governance) consisted of guardrails that help ensure that AI tools and systems remain safe and ethical.\n\nAI governance encompasses oversight mechanisms that address risks. An ethical approach to AI governance requires the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including developers, users, policymakers and ethicists, helping to ensure that AI-related systems are developed and used to align with society's values.\n\nHere are common values associated with AI ethics and [responsible AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/responsible-ai):\n\n\n\n\nExplainability and interpretability\n\n\n\n\n\nAs AI becomes more advanced, humans are challenged to comprehend and retrace how the algorithm came to a result. [Explainable AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai?) is a set of processes and methods that enables human users to interpret, comprehend and trust the results and output created by algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nFairness and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough machine learning, by its very nature, is a form of statistical discrimination, the discrimination becomes objectionable when it places privileged groups at systematic advantage and certain unprivileged groups at systematic disadvantage, potentially causing varied harms. To encourage fairness, practitioners can try to minimize algorithmic bias across data collection and model design, and to build more diverse and inclusive teams.\n\n\n\n\nRobustness and security\n\n\n\n\n\nRobust AI effectively handles exceptional conditions, such as abnormalities in input or malicious attacks, without causing unintentional harm. It is also built to withstand intentional and unintentional interference by protecting against exposed vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\nAccountability and transparency\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations should implement clear responsibilities and governance\nstructures for the development, deployment and outcomes of AI systems.\nIn addition, users should be able to see how an AI service works,\nevaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and\nlimitations. Increased transparency provides information for AI\nconsumers to better understand how the AI model or service was created.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and compliance\n\n\n\n\n\nMany regulatory frameworks, including GDPR, mandate that organizations abide by certain privacy principles when processing personal information. It is crucial to be able to protect AI models that might contain personal information, control what data goes into the model in the first place, and to build adaptable systems that can adjust to changes in regulation and attitudes around AI ethics.\n\n## Weak AI vs. Strong AI\n\nIn order to contextualize the use of AI at various levels of complexity and sophistication, researchers have defined several types of AI that refer to its level of sophistication:\n\n**Weak AI**: Also known as “narrow AI,” defines AI systems designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks. Examples might include “smart” voice assistant apps, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, a social media chatbot or the autonomous vehicles promised by Tesla.\n\n**[Strong AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/strong-ai)**: Also known as “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) or “general AI,” possess the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or [surpassing human intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-superintelligence). This level of AI is currently theoretical and no known AI systems approach this level of sophistication. Researchers argue that if AGI is even possible, it requires major increases in computing power. Despite recent advances in AI development, self-aware AI systems of science fiction remain firmly in that realm.\n\n## History of AI\n\nThe idea of \"a machine that thinks\" dates back to ancient Greece. But since the advent of electronic computing (and relative to some of the topics discussed in this article) important events and milestones in the evolution of AI include the following:\n\n**1950**\n\nAlan Turing publishes [Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf). In this paper, Turing famous for breaking the German ENIGMA code during WWII and often referred to as the \"father of computer science\" asks the following question: \"Can machines think?\"\n\nFrom there, he offers a test, now famously known as the \"Turing Test,\" where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since it was published, it remains an important part of the history of AI, and an ongoing concept within philosophy as it uses ideas around linguistics.\n\n**1956**\n\nJohn McCarthy coins the term \"artificial intelligence\" at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. (McCarthy went on to invent the Lisp language.) Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw and Herbert Simon create the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI computer program.\n\n**1967**\n\nFrank Rosenblatt builds the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first computer based on a neural network that \"learned\" through trial and error. Just a year later, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert publish a book titled Perceptrons, which becomes both the landmark work on neural networks and, at least for a while, an argument against future neural network research initiatives.\n\n**1980**\n\nNeural networks, which use a backpropagation algorithm to train itself, became widely used in AI applications.\n\n**1995**\n\nStuart Russell and Peter Norvig publish [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), which becomes one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems based on rationality and thinking versus acting.\n\n**1997**\n\nIBM's Deep Blue beats then world chess champion Garry Kasparov, in a chess match (and rematch).\n\n**2004**\n\nJohn McCarthy writes a paper, [What Is Artificial Intelligence?](https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai.pdf), and proposes an often-cited definition of AI. By this time, the era of big data and cloud computing is underway, enabling organizations to manage ever-larger data estates, which will one day be used to train AI models.\n\n**2011**\n\nIBM Watson® beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy! Also, around this time, data science begins to emerge as a popular discipline.\n\n**2015**\n\nBaidu's Minwa supercomputer uses a special deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy than the average human.\n\n**2016**\n\nDeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves). Later, Google purchased DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million.\n\n**2022**\n\nA rise in [large language models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) or LLMs, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, creates an enormous change in performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. With these new generative AI practices, deep-learning models can be pretrained on large amounts of data.\n\n**2024**\n\nThe latest [AI trends](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/artificial-intelligence-trends) point to a continuing AI renaissance. Multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input are providing richer, more robust experiences. These models bring together [computer vision](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision) image recognition and NLP speech recognition capabilities. Smaller models are also making strides in an age of diminishing returns with massive models with large parameter counts.\n\n[Ebook\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to choose the right foundation model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\\\\\n\\\\\nRead the ebook](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52620)\n\n## Resources\n\n[Report\\\\\n\\\\\nIBM is named a Leader in Data Science & Machine Learning\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn why IBM has been recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms.\\\\\n\\\\\nRead the report](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-53728)\n\n[Report\\\\\n\\\\\nFrom AI projects to profits: How agentic AI can sustain financial returns\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn how organizations are shifting from launching AI in disparate pilots to using it to drive transformation at the core.\\\\\n\\\\\nRead the report](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/agentic-ai-profits)\n\n[Training\\\\\n\\\\\nLevel up your AI expertise\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAccess our full catalog of over 100 online courses by purchasing an individual or multi-user subscription today, enabling you to expand your skills across a range of our products at a low price.\\\\\n\\\\\nStart learning](https://www.ibm.com/training/artificial-intelligence)\n\n[AI models\\\\\n\\\\\nExplore IBM Granite\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIBM® Granite® is a family of open, performant and trusted AI models tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.\n\nThis learning process often involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information.\n\n[Deep learning](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-deep-learning), a further specialization, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process information, mimicking the structure and function of the human brain. Through continuous learning and adaptation, AI systems become increasingly adept at performing specific tasks, from recognizing images to translating languages and beyond.\n\nWant to learn how to get started with AI? Take the free beginner's [introduction to generative AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118??utm_source=cgc-site&utm_medium=et&utm_campaign=FY24-Q2-global-website-skillsboost&utm_content=developers&utm_term=-).\n\n## Types of artificial intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed.\n\nFor instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.\n\n1. **Reactive machines:** Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.\n2. **Limited memory:** Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.\n3. **Theory of mind:** Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would.\n4. **Self aware:** A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist.\n\nA more useful way of broadly categorizing types of artificial intelligence is by what the machine can do. All of what we currently call artificial intelligence is considered artificial “narrow” intelligence, in that it can perform only narrow sets of actions based on its programming and training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for object classification won’t be able to perform natural language processing. Google Search is a form of narrow AI, as is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants.\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability for a machine to “sense, think, and act” just like a human. AGI does not currently exist. The next level would be artificial superintelligence (ASI), in which the machine would be able to function in all ways superior to a human.\n\n## Artificial intelligence training models\n\nWhen businesses talk about AI, they often talk about “training data.” But what does that mean? Remember that limited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves over time by being trained with new data. Machine learning is a [subset of artificial intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/learn/artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning) that uses algorithms to train data to obtain results.\n\nIn broad strokes, three kinds of learnings models are often used in machine learning:\n\n**Supervised learning** is a machine learning model that maps a specific input to an output using labeled training data (structured data). In simple terms, to train the algorithm to recognize pictures of cats, feed it pictures labeled as cats.\n\n**Unsupervised learning** is a machine learning model that learns patterns based on unlabeled data (unstructured data). Unlike supervised learning, the end result is not known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data, categorizing it into groups based on attributes. For instance, unsupervised learning is good at pattern matching and descriptive modeling.\n\nIn addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, a mixed approach called semi-supervised learning is often employed, where only some of the data is labeled. In semi-supervised learning, an end result is known, but the algorithm must figure out how to organize and structure the data to achieve the desired results.\n\n**Reinforcement learning** is a machine learning model that can be broadly described as “learn by doing.” An “agent” learns to perform a defined task by trial and error (a feedback loop) until its performance is within a desirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement learning would be teaching a robotic hand to pick up a ball.\n\n## Common types of artificial neural networks\n\nA common type of training model in AI is an artificial neural network, a model loosely based on the human brain.\n\nA neural network is a system of artificial neurons—sometimes called perceptrons—that are computational nodes used to classify and analyze data. The data is fed into the first layer of a neural network, with each perceptron making a decision, then passing that information onto multiple nodes in the next layer. Training models with more than three layers are referred to as “deep neural networks” or “deep learning.” Some modern neural networks have hundreds or thousands of layers. The output of the final perceptrons accomplish the task set to the neural network, such as classify an object or find patterns in data.\n\nSome of the most common types of artificial neural networks you may encounter include:\n\n**Feedforward neural networks (FF)** are one of the oldest forms of neural networks, with data flowing one way through layers of artificial neurons until the output is achieved. In modern days, most feedforward neural networks are considered “deep feedforward”with several layers (and more than one “hidden” layer). Feedforward neural networks are typically paired with an error-correction algorithm called “backpropagation” that, in simple terms, starts with the result of the neural network and works back through to the beginning, finding errors to improve the accuracy of the neural network. Many simple but powerful neural networks are deep feedforward.\n\n**Recurrent neural networks (RNN)** differ from feedforward neural networks in that they typically use time series data or data that involves sequences. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which use weights in each node of the network, recurrent neural networks have “memory” of what happened in the previous layer as contingent to the output of the current layer. For instance, when performing natural language processing, RNNs can “keep in mind” other words used in a sentence. RNNs are often used for speech recognition, translation, and to caption images.\n\n**Long/short term memory (LSTM)** is an advanced form of RNN that can use memory to “remember” what happened in previous layers. The difference between RNNs and LSTM is that LSTM can remember what happened several layers ago, through the use of “memory cells.” LSTM is often used in speech recognition and making predictions.\n\n**Convolutional neural networks (CNN)** includesome of the most common neural networks in modern artificial intelligence. Most often used in image recognition, CNNs use several distinct layers (a convolutional layer, then a pooling layer) that filter different parts of an image before putting it back together (in the fully connected layer). The earlier convolutional layers may look for simple features of an image, such as colors and edges, before looking for more complex features in additional layers.\n\n**Generative adversarial networks (GAN)** involve two neural networks competing against each other in a game that ultimately improves the accuracy of the output. One network (the generator) creates examples that the other network (the discriminator) attempts to prove true or false. GANs have been used to create realistic images and even make art.\n\n### Benefits of AI\n\n### Automation\n\nAI can automate workflows and processes or work independently and autonomously from a human team. For example, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of different kinds of AI in use, such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure efficiency and output.\n\n### Reduce human error\n\nAI can eliminate manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time.\n\n### Eliminate repetitive tasks\n\nAI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing human capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can be used to automate processes, like verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, or answering simple customer questions like “what time do you close?” Robots are often used to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks in the place of a human.\n\n### Fast and accurate\n\nAI can process more information more quickly than a human, finding patterns and discovering relationships in data that a human may miss.\n\n### Infinite availability\n\nAI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks, or other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud, AI and machine learning can be “always on,” continuously working on its assigned tasks.\n\n### Accelerated research and development\n\nThe ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can lead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and development. For instance, AI has been used in predictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical treatments, or to quantify the human genome.\n\n### Solve your business challenges with Google Cloud\n\nNew customers get $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud.\n\nGet started [Get started](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial)\n\nSign up for Google Cloud newsletters with product updates, event information, special offers, and more.\n\nStay informed [Stay informed](https://cloud.google.com/newsletter)\n\n### Applications and use cases for artificial intelligence\n\n### Speech recognition\n\nAutomatically convert spoken speech into written text.\n\n### Image recognition\n\nIdentify and categorize various aspects of an image.\n\n### Translation\n\nTranslate written or spoken words from one language into another.\n\n### Predictive modeling\n\nMine data to forecast specific outcomes with high degrees of granularity.\n\n### Data analytics\n\nFind patterns and relationships in data for business intelligence.\n\n### Cybersecurity\n\nAutonomously scan networks for cyber attacks and threats.\n\n## Related products and services\n\nGoogle offers a number of sophisticated artificial intelligence products, solutions, and applications on a trusted cloud platform that enables businesses to easily build and implement AI algorithms and models.\n\nBy using products like [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hub), [CCAI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/contact-center),\n\n[DocAI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai)\n\n, or [AI APIs](https://cloud.google.com/ai/apis), organizations can make sense of all the data they’re producing, collecting, or otherwise analyzing, no matter what format it’s in, to make actionable business decisions.\n\n- [![Cloud](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/rc7m6af1wpQO_v5GlttqQ_nbbC4jLY0EEN4aVof8WsJLmVyWrtPTHYb5XSm4sJY_142oDc1IsIs.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nExplore all AI products and solutions\\\\\n\\\\\nInnovative AI and machine learning products, solutions, and services powered by Google’s research and technology.](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai)\n- [![Vertex AI](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/me6u4lx8TR7uZxMdl7YC5WlyZC0P2y0LzMAYP3mICUJJz4x7eZ0AXWaXc3n9EPNxfvCoFc6Y3mmmGg.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nVertex AI\\\\\n\\\\\nBuild, deploy, and scale ML models faster, with pretrained and custom tooling within a unified artificial intelligence platform.](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)\n- [![Vertex AI ](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/me6u4lx8TR7uZxMdl7YC5WlyZC0P2y0LzMAYP3mICUJJz4x7eZ0AXWaXc3n9EPNxfvCoFc6Y3mmmGg.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nVertex AI Studio \\\\\n\\\\\nTool for rapidly prototyping and testing generative AI models.](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio)\n- [![Document AI](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/cvl2iROAmlw6oqzO5Xsw4sU_2iAlg6UYuNjpZZir9FDNMGEsfAutoqHyFAy4l_mbEb0d-UY5TC67.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nDocument AI\\\\\n\\\\\nAutomate data capture at scale to reduce document processing costs.](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai)\n- [![AlloyDB AI icon](https://www.gstatic.com/bricks/image/A7NDzHSjhN7otiP1pd3-d37aQgC0c07khXBeOO5ILx_PO_I8690EcpLH5Uun0QwNVy7khMrqil8.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nAlloyDB AI\\\\\n\\\\\nBuild a wide range of generative AI applications using familiar PostgreSQL and run models in Vertex AI.](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/ai)\n- [Solution\\\\\n\\\\\nContact Center AI\\\\\n\\\\\nDeliver exceptional customer service and increase operational efficiency using artificial intelligence.

The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the [intellectual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual) processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since their development in the 1940s, [digital computers](https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-computer) have been programmed to carry out very complex tasks—such as discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing [chess](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess)—with great proficiency. Despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match full human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in executing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as [diverse](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diverse) as medical [diagnosis](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diagnosis), computer [search engines](https://www.britannica.com/technology/search-engine), voice or handwriting recognition, and [chatbots](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chatbot).\n\n## What is intelligence?\n\n**What do you think?**\n\n- **[Is Artificial Intelligence Good for Society?](https://www.britannica.com/procon/artificial-intelligence-AI-debate)**\n\n\n**Explore the ProCon debate**\n\nAll but the simplest human behavior is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated [insect](https://www.britannica.com/animal/insect) behavior is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behavior of the digger [wasp](https://www.britannica.com/animal/wasp), _Sphex ichneumoneus_. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the [threshold](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/threshold), checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s [instinctual behavior](https://www.britannica.com/animal/insect/Role-of-hormones#ref41274) is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of the wasp—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.\n\n[Psychologists](https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology) generally characterize [human intelligence](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-intelligence-psychology) not by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, [problem solving](https://www.britannica.com/science/problem-solving), [perception](https://www.britannica.com/topic/perception), and using language.\n\n## [Learning](https://www.britannica.com/technology/machine-learning)\n\nThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple [computer](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer) program for solving mate-in-one [chess](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess) problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that, the next time the computer encountered the same position, it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to [implement](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implement) on a computer. More challenging is the problem of [implementing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implementing) what is called [generalization](https://www.britannica.com/topic/generalization). Generalization involves applying past experience to [analogous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analogous) new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as _jump_ unless the program was previously presented with _jumped_, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add _-ed_” rule for regular verbs ending in a consonant and so form the past tense of _jump_ on the basis of experience with similar verbs.\n\n[_(Read Ray Kurzweil’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonbiological Man.”)_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nonbiological-Man-Hes-Closer-Than-You-Think-2118807)\n\n[![computer chip. computer.

[About Britannica AI.](https://britannica.com/about-britannica-ai)\n\n# Reasoning\n\nAI & your money\n\nArtificial intelligence is changing how we interact online, how we manage our finances, and even how we work. Learn more with **Britannica Money**.\n\n- [Using AI for money management](https://www.britannica.com/money/generative-ai-financial-use-cases)\n\n- [How AI is changing work](https://www.britannica.com/money/examples-of-ai-in-the-workplace)\n\n- [Ethical questions and AI](https://www.britannica.com/money/ai-ethical-issues)\n\n- [AI and regulation](https://www.britannica.com/money/ai-rules-and-regulations)\n\n- [Investing in AI stocks](https://www.britannica.com/money/investing-in-ai-stocks)\n\n\nTo reason is to draw [inferences](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inferences) appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either [deductive](https://www.britannica.com/topic/deduction-reason) or [inductive](https://www.britannica.com/topic/induction-reason). An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore, he is in the museum,” and of the latter is, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure. This accident is of the same sort; therefore, it was likely caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case, the truth of the [premises](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premises) guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case, the truth of the premises lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute [assurance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assurance). Inductive reasoning is common in [science](https://www.britannica.com/science/science), where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behavior—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in [mathematics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics) and [logic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic), where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules.\n\nThere has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences: it involves drawing inferences _relevant_ to the solution of the particular problem. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI.\n\n## [Problem solving](https://www.britannica.com/science/problem-solving)\n\nProblem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution. Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose. A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded. In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems. One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or [incremental](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incremental), reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal. The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple [robot](https://www.britannica.com/technology/robot-technology), this might consist of PICKUP, PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached.\n\nMany [diverse](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diverse) problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs. Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game, devising mathematical proofs, and manipulating “virtual objects” in a computer-generated world.\n\n## Perception\n\n[![facial recognition](https://cdn.britannica.com/72/96672-050-44278067/3d-facial-recognition-program.jpg?w=300)](https://cdn.britannica.com/72/96672-050-44278067/3d-facial-recognition-program.jpg)\n\n[facial recognition](https://cdn.britannica.com/72/96672-050-44278067/3d-facial-recognition-program.jpg) Three-dimensional facial recognition program shown at a biometrics conference in London, 2004.(more)\n\nIn [perception](https://www.britannica.com/topic/perception) the [environment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment) is scanned by means of various sensory organs, real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in various spatial relationships. Analysis is complicated by the fact that an object may appear different depending on the angle from which it is viewed, the direction and intensity of illumination in the scene, and how much the object contrasts with the surrounding field. At present, artificial perception is sufficiently advanced to enable optical sensors to identify individuals and enable [autonomous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonomous) vehicles to drive at moderate speeds on the open road.\n\n## [Language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/language)\n\nA [language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/language) is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense, language need not be confined to the spoken word. Traffic signs, for example, form a mini-language, it being a matter of convention that ⚠ means “hazard ahead” in some countries. It is distinctive of languages that linguistic units possess meaning by convention, and linguistic meaning is very different from what is called natural meaning, exemplified in statements such as “Those clouds mean rain” and “The fall in pressure means the valve is malfunctioning.”\n\nAn important [characteristic](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/characteristic) of full-fledged human languages—in contrast to birdcalls and traffic signs—is their productivity. A productive language can formulate an unlimited variety of sentences.\n\nLarge language models like [ChatGPT](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ChatGPT) can respond fluently in a human language to questions and statements. Although such models do not actually understand language as humans do but merely select words that are more probable than others, they have reached the point where their command of a language is indistinguishable from that of a normal human. What, then, is involved in genuine understanding, if even a computer that uses language like a native human speaker is not acknowledged to understand? There is no universally agreed upon answer to this difficult question.\n\n_[(Read Yuval Noah Harari’s Britannica essay on the future of “Nonconscious Man.”)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Our-Nonconscious-Future-2119857)_\n\nLoad Next Page\n\nFeedback\n\n\nCorrections?
