You don’t really need me to tell you about it, do you? After all, it was the best selling electric car in the UK and across the whole world, in 2024. Oh, and in 2023. And yup, you guessed it – in 2022, too. So, this new one? It's pretty big news.\n\n- Pros:Interior space and comfort, easy rapid charging\n- Cons:No seven-seater for now, ride still firm\n\nShare on:\n\n[Why you can trust our independent reviews](https://www.electrifying.com/about-us)\n\nTesla’s All-New 2025 Model Y: Everything You Need to Know \\| Electrifying - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Electrifying](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29JbxEwr7q5bP7ANJMSqAg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.electrifying.com%2F)\n\nElectrifying\n\n177K subscribers\n\n[Tesla’s All-New 2025 Model Y: Everything You Need to Know \\| Electrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxu8e95Bx4A)\n\nElectrifying\n\nSearch\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

It’s also more aerodynamic, has a stiffer body shell to improve handling and comfort, and it’s said to be quieter and more comfortable on the move.\n\nThe Model Y remains much the same size, and at 4.79-metres long it’s still a rival for a huge array of other electric SUVs, ranging from premium stuff like the [Porsche Macan](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/porsche-reviews/macan-electric/review) and [Audi Q6 e-tron](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/audi-reviews/q6-e-tron-2/review) through to more affordable alternatives like the [Ford Mustang Mach-E](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/ford/mustang-mach-e/review), [BYD Sealion 7](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/byd/sealion-7/review), Peugeot E-3008, [Skoda Enyaq](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/skoda-reviews/new-enyaq/review), [Kia EV6](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/kia/ev6/review), [Renault Scenic E-Tech](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/renault-reviews/scenic-e-tech/review) and Toyota bZ4X.\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9N-4Xo5kq3ZAP/NewModelY_80.jpg)\n\nFor this 2025 Model Y, Tesla has given it a new fascia with a lower front splitter and a sleek, full-width headlight that’s a bit reminiscent of the [Cybertruck](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla-reviews/cybertruck/review) or Robotaxi. Or of Cyclops from X-Men, if you ask me. You get the gist – it’s all very futuristic and minimalist, and I actually rather like it. It’s also key to the improved aerodynamics that have allowed Tesla to squeeze an extra 20 miles or so out of the official [range](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=range) figures, making this one of the longest range electric SUVs you can buy.\n\nThe back of the Model Y looks cool, too. I really love the way the new light strip is hidden, and reflects onto the bodywork so that you get a sort of ‘ambient’ look to it. It's a bit different to the straightforward LED lightstrips that have become a bit ubiquitous on a lot of modern cars.\n\n## **Range, Battery and Charging**\n\nThe Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive has an official [WLTP](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=WLTP) range of 311 miles, and a 0-60mph time of 5.6 seconds. The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive has up to 387 miles of WLTP range and a 0-60mph of 5.4 seconds, with the Long Range All-Wheel Drive offering 364 miles of range (WLTP) and a 0-60mph time of 4.6 seconds. The Performance model is almost inevitable, but details haven't yet been confirmed.\n\n“Tesla doesn’t state battery capacities.” So said the nice man from Tesla when I asked him about the Model Y, and I can’t say I was surprised. I’ve been asking Tesla representatives about battery specifics for a decade now, and have always had the same response. Never mind. It’s annoying, especially as the details inevitably find their way onto the internet via the ever-enthusiastic Tesla owners clubs, anyway, but it’s safe to say that the [Tesla Model Y](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-y/review) has retained its 75kWh lithium-ion NMC battery and has made [range](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=range) gains through aerodynamic improvements.\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9Jk4Xo5kq3ZAN/NewModelY_77.jpg)\n\n[Rapid charging](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=Rapid%20charging) speeds peak at 250kW, which is nothing new for the Model Y, but still makes this one of the fastest-charging electric family cars. It’s up there with the Porsche Macan, Audi Q6 e-tron and [Kia EV6](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/kia/ev6/review) for that, and will manage a 10-80% top-up in well under 30 minutes.\n\nObviously, being a Tesla, you have access to the Tesla Supercharger network. Let’s face it - this remains a benchmark for cost and reliability when it comes to public rapid charging, and is still a big incentive for high mileage drivers.\n\n**[Considering a used Tesla? Check out the secondhand cars for sale on Electrifying.com](https://www.electrifying.com/used-cars/tesla/?per-page=10)**\n\n## **Practicality and Boot Space**\n\nYou do lose 20-litres of space in the 2025 [Tesla Model Y](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-y/review)’s boot, as a result of the new, electrically-folding rear seats, but the boot space is still pretty huge with a total load capacity of 2,138 litres including the frunk. More than that, the rear seats now fold flat electrically and the bootlid is powered, too. There’s also a funky, magnetic loadbay cover that you can fold up and back, and that can also be stowed away in a dedicated cubby under the boot floor. Speaking as a dog owner, this sort of stuff is a lifesaver when you want to get the dog in the boot, but don’t want to leave the loadbay cover behind.\n\nUp front in the cabin, there’s some big news… And it comes in the form of the indicator stalk. This is controversial, because the ‘Highlander’ [2024 Model 3](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-3/review) became infamous for the indicator buttons on the steering wheel, which replaced its indicator stalk, and which many of us really didn’t get along with. Not least, our illustrious leader, Ginny [(you can check out her opinion, here)](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-3/review).\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9Sk4Xo5kq3ZAT/NewModelY_93.jpg)\n\nTesla won’t confirm that it’s chosen to keep an indicator stalk on the Model Y because, well, there was a lot of hate for the indicator buttons on the 3. But it seems logical that that’s why the Y has a ‘precision engineered’ stalk. Anyway, regardless of why it’s there, we’re very pleased that it is.\n\nThe rest of the interior is improved with better material finish and ambient lighting, while the glass also reflects 26% more of the sunlight to keep the interior cool in the summer and reduce glare.\n\nAs ever with the Y, space isn’t a problem and even a tall adult will be alright in the back despite that swoopy roofline.\n\nOne last thing to know: the seven-seat [Tesla Model Y](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-y/review) that only arrived last year (after a very, very long wait)? That's not confirmed for this facelift, yet. And they've sold out of the ones that did get brought into the UK. So if you want a seven-seat Model Y, you're out of luck [unless you want to buy used](https://www.electrifying.com/used-cars/). And even then, there aren't many out there.\n\n## **Interior, Design/Styling and Technology**\n\nThe 15.4-inch touchscreen stays much the same, and is still your portal to all of the car’s inner workings and functions, but obviously with Tesla’s over-the-air software updates it’ll always have the latest software. Still no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but it’s a good system regardless.\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9Vk4Xo5kq3ZAV/NewModelY_96.jpg)\n\nTech upgrades include improved wi-fi hotspot that’s now got greater [range](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=range) and faster download speeds. The phone key performance has also improved thanks to the addition of ‘ultra wideband’. Nope, I don’t know what that is, either, but it means that - if you set your phone up so that it functions as your car key for keyless entry and drive – the car will now sense your phone more reliably and from a bit further away.\n\nOther improvements include redesigned seats, which are usefully comfier than the seats you got in the pre-facelift Model Y. There's more side support in the front seats, and longer seat squabs in the back, and they feel a bit softer to me. Just nicer all round, really.\n\nThe trademark huge panoramic glass roof is still standard, too, which makes the whole thing feel nice and airy. You also get an 8.0-inch colour screen in the back, now, which controls the [climate control](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=climate%20control) in the back, or you can do some gaming on it.\n\nOverall, the improved materials and new ambient lighting have lifted the feel of the Model Y’s interior so that it now feels noticeably classier, even if Porsche, BMW and Audi don’t need to worry about Tesla bettering their cabin quality any time soon.\n\n## **Motors, Performance and Handling**\n\nI spent a few days running around in the [Tesla Model Y](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-y/review) Long Range AWD (the Launch Edition, to be specific), and it is a noticeable improvement on the older Model Y. It’s still not the comfiest in terms of ride comfort; there’s noticeable thumps and jarring over patched up town roads, although it settles much better at higher speeds than the pre-facelift Model Y.\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9FV4Xo5kq3ZAK/NewModelY_74.jpg)\n\nA new steering wheel is another improvement; it’s a bit slimmer and looks nicer, which only helps you to enjoy the fairly quick but well-weighted steering. It really does feel quite sporty, the Model Y. Not in quite the engaging, sports-SUV way that the Macan does, but it turns nicely into corners and generally feels keyed in. Just a bit sharper and more assertive than the Skoda Enyaq, really, although the Skoda’s the better bet if you want a soft, cushy ride.\n\nRefinement is okay in the Tesla; again, it’s improved but it’s still not the best in class. There’s a bit of wind noise, albeit nothing that’s going to really bother you, and tyre noise is quite noticeable off the 20-inch Michelin tyres that were fitted to our test car.\n\nPerformance? I mean, yeah, it’s got that. The AWD Long Range manages 0-60mph in 4.6 seconds, so it’s not short of acceleration when you want it, and you can really shock your kids if you want to.\n\nAs with the Model 3, the Model Y only has one, heavy brake regen’ setting that means you drive around almost all of the time just using the accelerator pedal – you barely need to use the brake pedal at all, although it’s got perfectly decent feel and response when you do.\n\nGenerally, it’s a slick and impressive drive, the Model Y. A [Kia EV6](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/kia/ev6/review) is a bit sharper and more fun to drive (if a lot smaller inside), and the Enyaq is comfier yet misses out on the convenience and lower costs of the Tesla Supercharger network.\n\n## **Running Costs and Pricing**\n\nOrders are open now and deliveries begin in May this year for the 'Juniper' [Tesla Model Y](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla/model-y/review) AWD Long Range Launch Edition, but at £60,995 it's surprisingly expensive and we'd say you're better off waiting a few weeks longer to get hold of one of the standard models.\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9Lk4Xo5kq3ZAO/NewModelY_78.jpg)\n\nThe Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive starts from £48,990, while the Long Range All-Wheel Drive starting from £51,990, which is actually some £1,000 cheaper than previously! Either of these are great value, as is the-entry level Model Y Rear-Wheel Drive that starts at  £44,990. Deliveries of these rather better value models are due to start in early summer 2025, so there's not too long to wait.\n\nAll new Model Y vehicles include front and rear lightbars, acoustic glass, an 8-inch rear touchscreen, powered boot opening, customisable ambient lighting, and an additional front facing camera. The Launch Edition does get some upgraded features including ventilated front seats, some exclusive badging and kick-plate design, but it's really not worth the extra money, if you ask me.\n\nEnhanced Autopilot, which includes semi-autonomous lane-changes and motorway slip-road control (on top of the standard adaptive cruise control) is a £3,800 option on every Model Y.\n\n'Full Self-Driving Capability' includes traffic light- and stop-sign recognition, and will also be updated automatically as Tesla introduces more upgrades in future. Mind you, it costs £6,800 and we can't stress enough that it is not - I repeat, NOT - an actual self-driving mode. It is probably the best and most advanced semi-autonomous driving system on sale. But even with it fitted, a Tesla will not drive itself. And it's not going to drive itself any time soon. So don't be fooled by the very misleading 'full self-driving' name. Rant over...\n\nObviously, the final decision for most potential Model Y buyers will come down to monthly finance costs, which start from £399 for the entry level car, £449 per month for the Long Range RWD and £499 for the Long Range AWD, assuming a deposit of £6,000 and a contract of 48 months.\n\nThose are some very competitive monthly deals, but if you want to grab a real bargain [then you can always check out our weekly deals page](https://www.electrifying.com/blog/best-cars/deal-of-the-week-the-best-electric-car-lease-deals), which is updated every week with the very best electric car deals every week.\n\n![](https://www.electrifying.com/files/OzF9OF4Xo5kq3ZAQ/NewModelY_86.jpg)\n\n## **Verdict**\n\nOverall, the [new 2025 Tesla Model Y](https://www.electrifying.com/reviews/tesla-reviews/model-y-2025/review) feels like more of the same – but better. We like all of the updates, including the style stuff, and the comfier seats and prospect of better ride comfort and refinement definitely sound good to us. It’s great to drive, and now more comfortable as well – which was always our main issue previously.\n\nThe price of the Launch Edition is, frankly, a bit too much. But the more affordable models are good value and promise impressive [range](https://www.electrifying.com/ev-dictionary?word=range), tech and practicality for the money – not to mention the ever-tempting convenience of the Supercharger network.\n\nWe still prefer the Skoda Enyaq’s comfier approach to life, but the Model Y remains one of the best electric family cars out there.\n\n### **Like the Tesla Model Y?

That is a sad truth in life, but the silver lining of that cloud is that the not-so-good stuff also tends to terminate eventually. Into which bucket am I placing the 25 months I spent living with the blue Tesla Model Y Long Range you see here? Well, I'm kind of pouring my thoughts out in between, if I'm honest. As I write this I find myself vacillating between begrudging respect and terminal relief.\n\nThis car began its life as part of the Roadshow family, then stayed on with my family. If you read my [initial review](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2021-tesla-model-y-review/) and coverage of this car, you know that I was impressed with many things upon taking it home. But, more significant were the things about it that horrified me. That the car couldn't go five miles on cruise control without a phantom braking incident was simply unacceptable. As the months wore on, the Model Y's awful ride quality grated on my nerves more and more.\n\nIn the years since, many of my initial concerns have markedly improved. Yes, the phantom braking improved, new features made the car easier to live with, and we even got the long-awaited \"Full Self Driving\" that I never thought I'd see before this lease expired.\n\nHowever, the fact that FSD is still terrible makes me feel like maybe I wasn't actually wrong.\n\nDespite all that, the Model Y has earned begrudging respect from me over these years. This, then, will be one of those reviews where I meander back and forth from positive to negative. So, join me, if you would, and we'll see if we can't come to a reasonable conclusion.\n\n[Share](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/reflecting-on-25-months-with-a-tesla?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share)\n\n## The Foundational Stuff\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84163b26-d212-47ee-889e-c06bd6b0449f_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Xp_a!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84163b26-d212-47ee-889e-c06bd6b0449f_3000x2000.jpeg)\n\nMy split decision on this car begins with its driving dynamic. The Model Y can be remarkably fun to drive at times, but it's also frustratingly unrewarding at others and punishingly harsh throughout.\n\nWe'll start with the good: the power. The Model Y is legitimately quick. Rated at 4.8 seconds to 60 but feeling more sprightly than that, it launches forward harder than those 19-inch tires can manage. And, after just 15,000 miles, those tires are already showing wear — despite using a dedicated set of snow tires through the winter.\n\nThe steering, likewise, is very quick. Dead, with basically zero feedback, but quick. That speed and the small steering wheel make the Model Y feel nimble and engaging. For an EV that delivers remarkable efficiency, it offers big grins, too.\n\nUntil you get the slightest hint of wheelspin or slip, at which point the Tesla's safety nannies kill the power and ruin the fun. More on that in a moment.\n\n> ## _“Even minor imperfections in asphalt result in painful feedback in the cabin thanks to suspension with all the refinement of a kick in the ass.”_\n\nSo, the Model Y can sometimes be sweet, but it's also a literal headache. Even minor imperfections in asphalt result in painful feedback in the cabin thanks to suspension with all the refinement of a kick in the ass. This car crashes over every little bump, despite us going for the smaller, 19-inch wheels specifically to improve ride quality. Heaven help you if you pay extra for the 20-inchers.\n\nThat's a real shame because, on a smooth road, the dual-pane acoustic glass and other attributes of the Model Y make it calm and quiet. But, when every little bump rings through the cabin with percussive effect, you'll be counting the miles to the next Supercharger.\n\n## Winter Performance\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2513e5e-d56b-4622-8cbc-f0c64d592a95_1200x675.webp)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9lXv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2513e5e-d56b-4622-8cbc-f0c64d592a95_1200x675.webp) Low grip = no fun\n\nThe best part of driving in the winter was putting on a set of studded Nokian Hakkapeliitta 10 EV tires. Yes, they deliver great grip and aren't nearly as loud as the other studded tires I've run for years, but more importantly, their soft sidewalls actually made a noticeable improvement to the Model Y's ride quality. The improvement was so apparent that we tended to run them farther into the spring than seasonality demanded.\n\nOn the factory all-season tires, the Model Y was frankly a little scary in the snow. Those low-rolling-resistance tires are hard, not suited to proper winter performance. I've seen so, so many Model Y owners in forums and on Reddit telling people that they don't need snow tires, so let me make this clear:\n\nIf you live somewhere where it snows regularly, and if you want to be able to get home without white knuckles on a stormy day, you should buy a dedicated set of snow tires.\n\nThat said, the Model Y's stability control system does a respectable job of managing available grip. It’s just that those stock tires don’t offer much of the stuff. With the Nokians, however, the Model Y was a proper monster in the snow. Even when we were struggling to find a plow guy for our driveway and had to ford our way out a few times, the Model Y had no problem.\n\nThough that stability is good, it’s not fun. It simply does not react well to being driven aggressively in low-grip situations. As an avid ice racer, I like to get a little sideways when the conditions are bad and nobody's around. The Model Y will not allow that. Even on a frozen lake I could barely get the rear to kick out a wee little bit before the car cut all power.\n\nIt's a shame, but know that if you want to engage in any antics like that, you'll need to spring $4,000 for the Performance model and give up 27 miles of range to boot.\n\n## \"Full Self Driving\"\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92b418b9-04a3-469a-a223-7e1a85752ce9_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!m3N2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92b418b9-04a3-469a-a223-7e1a85752ce9_3000x2000.jpeg) In the software world, “beta” means broken\n\nI still can't bring myself to write \"Full Self Driving\" without quotes because I really can't think of a more blatant example of automotive hucksterism. \"Autopilot\" was bad enough. \"Full Self Driving?\" It's a blatant lie.\n\nWe'll start with the good. The phantom braking that plagued this car when it was new has been mostly fixed. The car you see here is one of the early Model Ys shipped without a radar sensor in the nose. It was one of the first to rely exclusively on the imaging sensors in the windshield to detect oncoming traffic.\n\nWhen I took this car home from the dealership, on non-divided highways, the car would routinely and regularly stomp on the brakes to avoid oncoming cars that were safely in the opposite lane. Sometimes this happened so aggressively the ABS kicked in.\n\nWhile this mostly happened on secondary roads, it also happened on the highway. Frankly, it was terrifying. I mentioned at the time this could cause a rear-ending, and indeed there have been [reports of this happening](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/iekn37/tesla_rear_ended_from_phantom_braking/) and [a lawsuit to boot](https://www.autobodynews.com/tesla-phantom-braking-class-action-lawsuit-includes-model-3-model-y.html).\n\nBy the end of our lease, the phantom braking had become far less frequent. When it did happen, it was less abrupt. I hope that means Tesla has legitimately found a fix and didn’t just neuter the car’s ability to detect legitimate oncoming collisions.\n\nThankfully, I never had a chance to test that out.\n\nWhile FSD has also evolved and improved, it's still a disaster. I took the car for a final drive just before turning it in, and it did terribly. The car didn't care when I intentionally took my eyes off the road for too long, but it asked that I constantly shake the steering wheel despite my hands never leaving the thing.\n\nFSD did a good job of managing speed and staying straight on the highway, but it routinely lingered in the left lane, holding up traffic behind, and later passed a semi-truck in the right lane. It also took an exit without using the turn signal, then swerved wildly between exit lanes before slowing down to 20 mph below the speed limit to get around a gentle curve. Perhaps worst of all, in the many times I had to take over to override, I had to really grip and twist the steering wheel. FSD simply does not want to yield control, which results in the whole car lurching.\n\n> ## _“At best, driving with FSD on is like riding shotgun with a pimply 15-year-old with a freshly minted learner's permit in their pocket.”_\n\nAt best, driving with FSD on is like riding shotgun with a pimply 15-year-old with a freshly minted learner's permit in their pocket. The idea of paying $12,000 for that privilege is absolutely insane. Super Cruise, BlueCruise, BMW's Driver Assistance Professional, and indeed Mercedes-Benz's Drive Pilot, are all wildly more reliable, more capable, and frankly more comfortable to use. They're also all significantly cheaper.\n\n## How Did That White Vinyl Stand Up to Dogs?\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1468a1a4-1b2e-41d8-8a67-0429bc53a410_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BcxT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1468a1a4-1b2e-41d8-8a67-0429bc53a410_3000x2000.jpeg) Legitimately dog- and denim-proof\n\nCompared to the high-end, vegan materials that companies like Volvo, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are putting in their EVs, the white vinyl inside of the Model Y looks and feels like a questionable choice for a 1970s-themed boudoir. For a car that carries luxury pricing, there's simply nothing luxurious about it.\n\nHowever, I have to give it respect. It held up. By the end of our lease, the driver's seat in particular was showing clear signs of blue staining. Like many white interiors before, denim was a challenge. I was left wondering whether we were about to be dinged with a penalty upon returning the car, but a few minutes with some Dr. Bronner's soap ( _Heal Earth!_) cleaned it right up.\n\nWe did use a hammock-style seat cover for the rear seats to protect them from the worst of what our dogs' paws had to offer. But, those sears still saw plenty of grit and grime and came out looking none the worse for wear.\n\nThe interior overall fared remarkably well.\n\n## Range and Efficiency\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44246d57-f374-401f-b5c7-bc9e4a055535_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GG8U!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44246d57-f374-401f-b5c7-bc9e4a055535_3000x2000.jpeg)\n\nWe put 15,410 miles on the Tesla over 25 months, less than we'd hoped, but, considering the pandemic shut down basically everything for a good portion of our ownership period, that's not so bad. In that time, the car consumed 4,272 kWh for a total efficiency of 277 Wh/mi. Or, that's 3.6 mi/kWh, which is more or less exactly the [EPA's estimate](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=46212), despite doing a fair bit of clod weather running on snow tires.\n\nIn general, the Tesla's predicted range tended to be accurate, and we rarely, if ever, had any range anxiety in the car. Easy access to Supercharging certainly helped that, but idle fees often meant we couldn't quite enjoy charging stops as we'd have liked. It used to be nice to go wander off and get a bite to eat while charging.\n\nWe did have one persistent issue, though: significant range loss while parked. A few times we left the Model Y at the airport and came back to find that it had lost upwards of half its charge. We toggled off Sentry Mode and everything we could, but it kept on happening. Best to leave it plugged in if you can.\n\n## Reliability and Quality\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dac43a-0d0c-40b2-bebc-68c9323852cb_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iL0M!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dac43a-0d0c-40b2-bebc-68c9323852cb_3000x2000.jpeg) Mystery leaves that somehow blew into a closed trunk\n\nSimply put, we never had a mechanical issue with the Model Y. It didn't have to go in for service once. And, while I've seen plenty of Teslas delivered to customers with gross panel misalignments and other similar issues, ours looked reasonably good coming out of the dealer.\n\nThat said, it wasn't perfect. Fog would cloud the taillights for days whenever the thing got wet, and we quickly learned to never put anything in the frunk we wanted to keep dry. I could be wrong, but it seems to me that having water ingress in a sealed portion of the car is probably bad.\n\n﻿Because of this, we never used the frunk. So, imagine my surprise when I opened it to make sure we hadn't left anything in there and found a handful of leaves. How did they get in there? From which tree did they fall and for how many miles did we carry them? I have no idea, but I hope they enjoyed the ride.\n\n## Cost\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F469883b1-b81a-4dc9-bc5e-0d524ab5a9f8_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4YDN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F469883b1-b81a-4dc9-bc5e-0d524ab5a9f8_3000x2000.jpeg)\n\nGiven how... dynamic Tesla pricing can be, I thought it'd be interesting to do the math on how much this car would cost were I to purchase another.\n\nThe final price of the Model Y Long Range you see here, with its options for paint, interior, tow hitch, and FSD, was $67,490. Configuring the same Long Range with the same options (including the now-optional charging adapter) leaves us with a final price of $66,880, including the $1,390 delivery fee, which has oddly gone up $190 in these two years.\n\nSo, despite all those fluctuations in between, the cost today is more or less the same.\n\nWhat isn't the same? The competition. The absolute cheapest Tesla Model Y is $50,490. The Mustang Mach-E starts at just under $43,000. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6 are even cheaper, and all are at least as nice to drive, if not nicer. And, with options like Volvo's EX30 coming soon, plus actual luxury options like the Audi Q8 E-Tron and Mercedes-Benz EQE SUV available for not much more, the Model Y's value proposition is questionable.\n\nIn this field, the Model Y really only stands out for its range, and there's so much more than range to consider.\n\n## Things I'll Miss\n\n- Dog Mode\n\n- The Range\n\n- The Supercharger Network ( [though not for long](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/counterpoints-on-the-teslaford-deal)...?)\n\n- The acceleration\n\n- The (lack of a) dealership experience\n\n\n## Things I’ll Not Miss\n\n- That ride quality\n\n- The word \"beta\" applied to a safety system\n\n- Random loss of charge while parked\n\n- The monthly payment\n\n- Being in any way financially associated with Elon Musk\n\n\n## The Final Factor\n\n[![](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636edfa9-57a8-431a-956b-81d7d8761384_3000x2000.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XCHt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F636edfa9-57a8-431a-956b-81d7d8761384_3000x2000.jpeg)\n\nThere's one final aspect of Model Y experience that I cannot ignore: the evolution of Tesla's brand image. Over these two years, owning a Tesla has become a de facto political statement. Whether you agree or disagree with Elon Musk's personal politics doesn't matter. His too-close association with this brand has made being seen in a Tesla implicit compliance with, or at least ambivalence towards, his beliefs.\n\nI've spoken with many Tesla owners who now feel uncomfortable being seen in their cars. They’re counting the months on their leases, canceling pre-orders, or selling their cars. This is, frankly, a massive shame.\n\nThe Tesla Model Y, for all its faults, has plenty of remarkable features and attributes that make it impossible to ignore. It is still a contender in the increasingly competitive electric crossover SUV segment, but for an growing number of people, Tesla's brand image makes it an untenable option.\n\nIf that's you, I don't blame you. If, on the other hand, you can put on your blinders and ignore, or indeed if you actually enjoy Musk's weapons-grade trolling, then you're getting one of the best combinations of range and performance in the segment. If, however, you're looking for something premium, something that actually deserves to be in the luxury segment, you can do better than a Model Y.\n\nNever say never, but I can't imagine ever owning another Model Y without a significant revamp. FSD needs a reboot before I'd even consider it more than a liability and I just can't fathom spending nearly $70,000 on a car this punishing to drive.\n\nSo, then, what _would_ I spend that much money on? We've recently added a new electric SUV to the family, one from another brand, and we couldn't be happier with our decision. I'll save that update for another day.\n\nSubscribe\n\n[![Michael Goulden's avatar](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3214553e-1b57-4c3f-8b00-08a3094d0430_144x144.png)](https://substack.com/profile/87333272-michael-goulden)\n\n[![Louie F's avatar](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61cceec3-0324-4e52-a1c8-a2e0818a2285_144x144.png)](https://substack.com/profile/30397212-louie-f)\n\n[![Brendan's avatar](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcceb26ae-e7c7-46ed-be68-9d8b7abeacf1_286x286.jpeg)](https://substack.com/profile/20859073-brendan)\n\n[![Dana Groulx's avatar](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbf03f34-f84c-4f04-8185-157707b8608e_1080x1080.jpeg)](https://substack.com/profile/154514612-dana-groulx)\n\n[![Kevin McCauley's avatar](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82c4345e-54c9-422e-8a16-891eda932a10_1920x1080.jpeg)](https://substack.com/profile/101696019-kevin-mccauley)\n\n14 Likes∙\n\n[1 Restack](https://substack.com/note/p-137272494/restacks?utm_source=substack&utm_content=facepile-restacks)\n\n14\n\n[21](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/reflecting-on-25-months-with-a-tesla/comments)\n\n1\n\n[Share](javascript:void(0))\n\n#### Discussion about this post\n\nCommentsRestacks\n\n![User's avatar](https://timstevens.substack.com/p/fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png)\n\n[![Kai F.

We never had the consistent phantom braking or the leaking frunk issues you did, but the rest is spot on. That ride quality grated on me for the few years we owned ours.\n\nWhen we bought ours, I never really had an issue with Musk. However, when we decided to sell, his lack of self-control and frankly terrible personality had progressed to the point that selling the car was an easy choice. It’s a shame.\n\nLoving the Ioniq 5 and the MME GT Premium.

block of College Avenue closed Thursday for crane work](https://www.14850.com/062541678-college-ave-crane-2506/ \"300 block of College Avenue closed Thursday for crane work\")\n\nIn October of 2023, my trusty 2011 Camry Hybrid was giving ominous warnings about an imminent battery replacement. “Check Hybrid System” convinced me that 12 years was a pretty good run and time to make the plunge into my first all-electric vehicle.  Because of their leadership position and vast charging network, Tesla was the obvious place to start the buying process.\n\nFor me, that buying process was a complete online experience.  No trips to a dealership, no walking the lot, no haggling with a salesperson and no more waiting in the show room while the manager was consulted.  Instead I perused an online catalog, selecting models, interior colors, exterior colors, wheel styles, and tow packages.  Prices and potential rebates were updated as I clicked.  I finally settled on a ruby red Model Y, with dual motor AWD, long-range, and the tow package.  The Y has ample cargo space and seemed most appropriate for family use.  The tow hitch means I could add a bike rack to family excursions.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice when driving a Model Y or any Tesla (and what every review dwells upon) is the acceleration.  It is truly impressive and one of the main benefits of the car.  Step on that pedal and the car goes.  And it does not matter whether you are going 0 to 60, 45 -70, or up a steep hill.  The acceleration is there, and it is smooth.  This is great for climbing the hills, highway driving, or moving through intersections.\n\nThe other driving feature that I love about the Model Y is its handling.  It takes the curves very well and is just a joy to drive.  I have an occasional 120-mile round-trip commute on winding hilly country roads that I look forward to.\n\nOne of the main turn-offs to electric vehicles is their range, or the lack thereof, thus the so-called “range anxiety.”  I get it, it was a serious concern in the weeks leading up to our purchase decision.  I cannot speak for other EVs, but for the long-range Model Y this turned out to be a nothingburger.  One of the first trips we took was from my house outside of Ithaca to my brother’s place outside of Worcester, MA, 300 miles.  Tesla provides a website to plan your trip and any charging that might be needed.  This trip planning capability is also built into the car’s navigation system.  We had several options along the way, but decided to stop at the Crossgates Mall in Albany where the car could charge, and we could get lunch and shop a little.  When we were done with lunch, the battery was charged enough to continue on to our final destination, and by the time we were done shopping, we had almost a full charge.\n\nOn the morning that we were to head back, a family emergency forced us to make a detour through Connecticut, then Westchester County, and then home.  This added 75 miles of unexpected travel in a completely new direction.  But it was not a problem.  The planning application quickly charted a route and identified the needed charging locations, another mall in Connecticut and the famous Roscoe Diner for the last leg home.\n\nFor day-to-day charging, I installed a Level 2 charger in my garage, which requires a 220V circuit and a robust electric service.  If you have such, this is a great way to keep your car charged.  That 120-mile commute I mentioned earlier can be easily accomplished on an 80% charge.  In the winter, when battery performance is poorer and the seat heaters are cranking, I will charge to 100%.\n\nThe Model Y has lots of options for hauling things.  Under the back hatch there is plenty of room for suitcases, bags, groceries, inflatable pool floats, and any of the other routine things you need to move about in family life.  There are two hidden compartments that provide additional storage, deep wells on the sides that can hold all the permanent accessories such as window cleaner, tissues, playing cards, or whatnot, and a frunk (front trunk) big enough to easily hold a roll-aboard suitcase.  When you have to up your hauling needs, the back seats fold down, opening up a large space for your kit.  I recently took the car camping, and with the seats folded down could fit a giant tent, a canopy, cooler, air mattress, table, chairs, and everything else you need to glamp in style.\n\n![A parked red Tesla model Y](https://www.14850.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/new-tesla-1024x768.jpeg)Tesla Model Y – 14850 Photo by Andy Page\n\nThere are some definite things about the Model Y that I would like to see improved, ranging from small conveniences to life safety issues.  Let’s start with the conveniences.  The only USB port that can be used for streaming media is in the glove box.  This is also the only place you can place a thumb drive for dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings.  This was a change from previous production runs, as the center console USB-C port previously had streaming capabilities.  A small note in the online documentation indicates that some cars may not have streaming capabilities from the center console.  As far as I can tell, some means all recent Model Ys.\n\nOK, no biggie, one USB hub later and you can get that media player going.  But another change is a little more problematic, and that is the lack of ultrasonic sensors.  Those sensors used to be included, but in October of 2022 Tesla decided that their camera-based computerized Tesla Vision will eventually be able to replace the ultrasonic sensors.  That’s right, eventually.  Apparently, an over-the-air software update will someday make this true.  But for now, the Park Assist, Autopark, Summon, and Smart Summon features are limited or not available at all, as the sensors have already been removed.  The kicker is that you are only informed of this loss of functionality after the purchase has been made.  You are then given an option to cancel your order or accept the reduced functionality.  At least that’s how it went down for me.\n\n**Related: [Drive Electric Challenge: Tesla Autopilot vs Ithaca Roads](https://www.14850.com/093038205-drive-electric-tesla-autopilot/ \"Drive Electric Challenge: Tesla Autopilot vs Ithaca Roads\")**\n\nA driving feature that I don’t love too much is the suspension.  Although there is no engine, the battery pack, motors, and wiring harness all contribute to a total weight of about 4,200 pounds.  The suspension just does not do a good job of cushioning this weight from even the most routine of bumps.  In my Camry, I could easily drive with an open mug of coffee and except when going over railroad tracks, and not have to worry about sloshing java juice.  Not the case with the Model Y.  Even the slightest bump seems to be amplified.  This is unlikely to be improved with an over-the-air update!\n\nBut the biggest downside to the Tesla Model Y is the lack of tactile, or physical, controls for basic vehicle functions like climate (heat and AC), radio or other audio, and even windshield wiper settings.  It’s a problem.  After driving the car for nine months, I am a bit shocked that the NHTSA gave this the green light.  The correct areas to touch are very small, and the locations are not intuitive.  This is compounded by the aforementioned poor suspension, as your finger is bouncing around trying to touch just the right place on the screen.  During normal driving, looking at the screen for even a second or two to find the control you need is too long to have your eyes off the road.  Now imagine you’ve entered a sudden downpour, and you need to use the touch screen to set your windshield wipers to high, and things just got dangerous.\n\nSo what’s the verdict?  I love driving my Model Y, though I must take extra care to keep my attention on the road.  The lack of tactile controls and the wanton deprecation of features irks me though, and if there were a strong alternative that provided the same range and driving experience, I would not let brand loyalty stand in the way of making a switch.\n\n**Read the 14850

It shares its underpinnings with the Tesla [Model 3 sedan](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-3), but the fastback SUV offers more cargo space and an optional third row of seats. A styling refresh for 2026 includes new fascias and [illumination elements](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a64176866/2025-tesla-model-y-matrix-led-headlights-us/) front and rear. Inside, the front seats are optimized for comfort, a redesigned dashboard, and new ambient lighting styles. These changes, along with an upgrade in overall material quality strives to help the Model Y rise to the standards set by other similarly-priced electric crossovers such as the [**Ford Mustang Mach-E**](https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/mustang-mach-e), the [**Hyundai Ioniq 5**](https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/ioniq-5) **,** and the [**Volkswagen ID.4**](https://www.caranddriver.com/volkswagen/id4) Like other Teslas, the Model Y’s quirky, touchscreen-based interface will appeal to some drivers and irk others. Nonetheless, it’s hard to argue with the Model Y’s EV competencies, including fast charging times, the Performance model's scorching acceleration, and driving range estimates that exceed 300 miles per charge.\n\nEV Buyer's Guide\n\nCar and Driver US\n\n![Playlist Back](data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" fill=\"%23ffffff\" viewBox=\"0 0 256

has received a styling makeover for 2026 that aligns it with its platform-mate, the Model 3 sedan, which was updated for the 2024 model year. The Model Y’s headlamps have been changed and are now connected by a full-width light bar along the front end. The 2026 Model Y also has received interior updates similar to those on the Model 3, including richer interior materials, more sound-deadening, available ventilated front seats, and a rear-seat passenger display, among other upgrades.\n\n## **Pricing and Which One to Buy**\n\nThe price of the 2026 Tesla Model Y starts at $46,630 and goes up to $61,630 depending on the trim and options.\n\n[![Recommended](https://www.caranddriver.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/check-circle-fill.074ad02.svg?primary=%25237ad69c)Long Range RWD\\\\\n\\\\\n$46,630](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-y-2025/specs/2026/tesla_model-y_tesla-model-y_2026/475465)\n\nLong Range AWD\n\n$50,630\n\n[Launch Series\\\\\n\\\\\n$61,630](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-y-2025/specs/2026/tesla_model-y_tesla-model-y_2026/469362)0$10k$20k$30k$40k$50k$60k$70k$80k$90k$100k\n\nWe'd stick with the [single-motor, rear-wheel drive model](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a64714189/rear-drive-2025-tesla-model-y/?utm_campaign=trueanthemFBCDphoto&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwY2xjawK5NtJleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETEyWkxjYnlYaHFndTdhbXIyAR43CxNNRpnHnLIL-gNRcqI4HGGc7aktW8N0sE-ohjK2tNJj5ESbN8QZjO5oEA_aem_uuXzuLfMJqnNCXkRIWPqVA) for its low price of entry and extended range. This entry-level Model Y still comes with plenty of desirable equipment, including 19-inch wheels, a fixed glass roof, a power rear liftgate, a 15.4-inch display screen, power-adjustable front seats and steering column, dual-zone automatic climate control, blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, and a 360-degree exterior camera system.\n\n## Want to compare the 2026 Tesla Model Y to other vehicles you're interested in?\n\nOur new compare tool provides a comprehensive, side-by-side look at up to five cars of your choice.\n\n[Compare Cars](https://www.caranddriver.com/compare/?trimIds=681f3abed8cf59938023f314)\n\nThis content is imported from Third party. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n[iframe](https://www.caranddriver.com/inventory/?year=2026&make=Tesla&model=Model+Y&bodystyle=suv&site=caranddriver&source=review-article&location=content&zip=23462&bg-color=F1F7F7&test-data=false#/lotlinx)\n\n## **EV Motor, Power, and Performance**\n\nThe rear-wheel drive Model Y comes with a single electric motor that makes 295 horsepower. All-wheel drive models get two motors—one in the front and one in the rear—which combine for 375 horsepower. The Model 3 sedan is offered with a 510-hp Performance trim, and we think this powertrain could easily migrate to the Model Y's lineup as well. When we get a chance to test drive the updated Model Y, we'll update this story with driving impressions and test results.\n\n## **0–60-MPH Times**\n\nWe haven't had a chance to test a 2026 Model Y yet, but Tesla says the rear-wheel drive model can hit 60 mph in 5.4 seconds while the dual-motor AWD model can do it in 4.6 seconds. We'll update this section as soon as we test one for ourselves.\n\n[![2025 tesla model y juniper](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/top&resize=980:*)View Exterior Photos](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g63387797/2025-tesla-model-y-juniper-gallery/)\n\nTesla\n\n## **Range, Charging, and Battery Life**\n\nTesla says rear-wheel drive Model Ys should deliver up to 357 miles of driving per charge on the standard 19-inch wheels. Upgrade to the larger 20-inch rollers, and the range estimate drops to 344 miles. The all-wheel drive version checks in with 327 miles of range with the 19s and 303 miles with the 20-inchers. Tesla says the Long Range RWD can add up to 182 miles of range in as little as 15 minutes, while the AWD version can add 169 miles in the same 15-minute time period.\n\n## **Fuel Economy and Real-World MPGe**\n\nAccording to the EPA, the Model Y RWD returns 125 MPGe, the AWD version sits at 117 MPGe, and the Performance AWD returns 104 MPGe, all in combined driving. MPGe stands for miles per gallon of gas equivalent, [an EPA metric that estimates PHEV and EV vehicle fuel efficiency](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a31863350/what-is-mpge/). We'll update this section with real-world results when we get a Model Y to test in-house.\n\n## **Interior, Comfort, and Cargo**\n\nThe Model Y doesn't come with the larger [Model X](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-x) crossover's complicated Falcon Wing doors; its interior is largely free of buttons and relies mostly on a large infotainment display positioned at the center of an uncluttered dashboard. A heavily tinted, all-glass roof lends an airy ambiance to the cabin. Faux leather upholstery covers the seats and niceties such as a power-adjustable steering column, heated front seats, and a dual-zone automatic climate control. The Model Y is strictly a two-row affair, as Tesla has discontinued the previously available third-row seats.\n\n[![2025 tesla model y juniper](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/top&resize=980:*)View Interior Photos](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g63393296/2025-tesla-model-y-juniper-interior-gallery/)\n\nTesla\n\n## **Infotainment and Connectivity**\n\nAccessing almost every function of the Model Y—from the climate controls to the speedometer—requires users to interact with the large, 15.4-inch infotainment display in the middle of the dashboard. The Model Y offers the same [**entertainment functions**](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30151777/tesla-model-3-entertainment-features/) as the Model 3, including embedded Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube apps, as well as video games, all perfect for killing time while waiting for the battery to charge at the public charging station. Don't worry, Tesla locks drivers out of using these distractions while the vehicle is moving. Rear-seat riders have access to an 8.0-inch display mounted to the back of the center console. This screen provides access to entertainment features as well as controls for climate control.\n\n## **Safety and Driver-Assistance Features**\n\nA driving-assist system comes standard on the Model Y, and Tesla's Full Self-Driving tech is available too. Despite its name, Full Self-Driving is not the self-driving feature the company would have you believe. All Model Ys still require the driver's attention and possible intervention. Still, these systems are useful for reducing fatigue on long highway drives. For more information about the Model Y's crash test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( [**NHTSA**](https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings)) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( [**IIHS**](https://www.iihs.org/)) websites. Key safety features include:\n\n- **Standard automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection**\n- **Standard lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist**\n- **Standard adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering feature**\n\n## **Warranty and Maintenance Coverage**\n\nThe warranty coverage for the Model Y mirrors that of the Model 3, [**Model S**](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-s), and Model X models. This means four years or 50,000 miles of bumper-to-bumper coverage and eight years or 100,000 miles of coverage for the battery and electric motors.\n\n- **Limited warranty covers 4 years or 50,000 miles**\n- **Powertrain warranty covers 8 years or 100,000 miles**\n- **No complimentary scheduled maintenance**\n\n[More Features and Specs](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-y-2024/specs/2025/tesla_model-y_tesla-model-y_2025)\n\n## Shopping Tools\n\n![Trade shopping tool](https://www.caranddriver.com/_assets/design-tokens/caranddriver/static/images/shopping-tools/trade-tool.6eb325a.svg)\n\nWhat's My Car Worth?\n\nCar and Driver values are calculated from the same Black Book® data dealers use to appraise vehicles.\n\n[Get Estimate](https://www.caranddriver.com/car-value-estimator/ \"Get Estimate\")\n\n![Insurance Marketplace icon](https://www.caranddriver.com/_assets/design-tokens/caranddriver/static/images/shopping-tools/insurance-marketplace.d49eb40.svg)\n\nInsurance Marketplace\n\nSee what you can save on car insurance.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.caranddriver.com/car-insurance/ \"Learn More\")\n\n![Finance Tool Icon](https://www.caranddriver.com/_assets/design-tokens/caranddriver/static/images/shopping-tools/finance-tool.19ce8d3.svg)\n\nAuto Loans & Financing\n\nOur finance experts answer any questions you may have about financing a vehicle.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.caranddriver.com/auto-loans/ \"Learn More\")\n\nThis content is imported from Third party.

Unhealthy obsession with classic Minis and old Alfas. Impenetrable Cumbrian accent\n\n[View all Tesla Reviews](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/tesla/ \"View all Tesla Reviews\")\n\n**►** **We’ve been driving the facelifted Model Y** **►** **And, somehow, it’s worse than the old car** **►** **Frustrating cabin and uncomfortable ride**\n\nTesla’s dealing with some bad PR right now. Its CEO is parading around on the political stage with the one of the world’s most powerful (and most unhinged) leaders, chucking Nazi salutes about like sweets and carving huge chunks out the US government’s workforce. He’s not exactly focused on cars. And it shows.\n\nThis [facelifted Model Y](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/first-official-pictures/tesla/tesla-model-y-uk-price-news-release-date-specs-range-and-interior/) demonstrates the extent of the problem. Tesla reckons it’s better to drive, more user-friendly, more comfortable and more efficient than before. But, having spent a day with the car, I’m not at all convinced. Like most of Tesla’s products, this updated Model Y’s seems to be founded on hype it can’t live up to.\n\nThat’s a shame, because Tesla does a lot of things very well. The brand still has the best electric car charging network, while its batteries and motors are amongst the finest on the market. Tesla’s _technology_ is good, but it completely loses its appeal once it’s been packaged into a Tesla _car_. Scroll down to find out why.\n\n## At a glance\n\n**Pros:** good battery efficiency, AWD model is properly quick, great charging network\n\n**Cons:** uncomfortable ride, irritating cabin ergonomics, everyone will hate you\n\n## What’s new?\n\nTesla started by tweaking the Model Y’s styling. It now has a new, Cybertruck-inspired front end, a fresh rear spoiler and a howling fridge-freezer of a backside. The company says the tweaks have improved the car’s aerodynamics which, in turn, has increased its maximum WLTP range from 373 to 387 miles.\n\nChanges to the cabin are far less noticeable. Tesla’s added a few aluminium accents, fitted a new 8.0-inch touchscreen for rear-seat passengers and redesigned the centre console (mostly by hiding the cupholders under a new sliding door). The brand also says it’s redesigned the Model Y’s seats, but they look damn-near identical to me.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: front static, silver paint](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/059-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nMore importantly, Tesla claims it’s improved the Model Y’s ride comfort and tweaked its suspension geometry. This was always something of a bugbear of ours on CAR magazine, as the old car was far too stiff to call even remotely comfortable – especially around town. As I’ll soon explain, though, the changes haven’t really worked.\n\n## What are the specs?\n\nThe entry-point to the range is the Rear-Wheel Drive, which has a 0–62mph time of 5.6 seconds and a maximum WLTP range 311 miles. Above that is the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, which gets a bigger battery (of undisclosed capacity), a shorter 0–62mph time of 5.4 seconds and a greater 387-mile maximum range.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: front three quarter driving, silver paint](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/051-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nThe top-spec car is badged Long Range All-Wheel Drive (brought about by an extra motor on the front axle). It has a 0–62mph time of 4.6 seconds and a 364-mile range.\n\n## Range and charging specs\n\nAny Model Y should be able to drive 300 miles in the real world before stopping to charge, which is probably why it’s the world’s most popular electric car. Convenience is king.\n\nWhile Tesla won’t tell me how big the Model Y’s batteries are, it has managed to find some partial specs on the car’s charging speeds. Apparently, if you connect it to one of its 250kW Superchargers, it should take on 150 miles of range in just 15 minutes. That’s as far as the specs go, though.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: rear three quarter static, silver paint](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/057-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nYou’d think someone at Tesla would have twigged that it’s important for buyers to know the capability of their cars, wouldn’t you?\n\n## How does it drive?\n\nIt’s a mixed bag. You can go a long way in the Model Y, but you probably won’t enjoy your journey because of the problems with its chassis. I encountered the first of these problems before I’d even left CAR magazine HQ. The steering’s weird.\n\nI’ve kicked countless metaphors for it around my laptop, but my best attempt at describing it is that it felt _rusty_. When I wound past a quarter of a turn, the column graunched and knocked like it’d spent the last month at the bottom of the Dead Sea.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: front three quarter driving, close up, silver paint](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/050-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nThe ride’s appalling, too. We complained at length about the old Model Y’s ride and, for this facelifted car, Tesla’s made it worse. It now has softer springs, but the damping doesn’t feel like it’s been adjusted to suit. That means it’s floaty until you hit a bump, at which point it immediately becomes uncomfortable as the granite dampers can’t compress quickly enough to absorb the impact. It’s irritatingly unsettled around town.\n\nThis change has influenced the handling, too. The old Model Y wasn’t too bad in corners – the cast iron chassis setup meant it controlled its two-tonne heft quite well. But this new car rolls around a lot more which is rather unnerving, especially when you consider how sterile the steering is.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: side view driving, long lens, silver paint](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/055-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nPut it all together and you’re left with a car that doesn’t exactly fill you with confidence. It’s certainly not a car for keen drivers. If you try and throw it down your favourite B-road, it’ll understeer into the verge long before rivals such as the Kia EV6 or BMW iX2. I managed to get the Tesla’s tyres screaming and its front end washing wide at just 40mph.\n\nFind a straight bit of road, though, and you’ll embarrass most things short of a supercar. The AWD version is very, very fast. I’ve never had a bike licence, but I assume this must be what it feels like to ride one because, if you can see a gap in the traffic, you’ve always got the power to exploit it.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: rear three quarter driving, close up, silver paint](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/052-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nHaving that reserve of power is a good thing because everyone else on the road will hate you, doing their best to stop you overtaking or merging. I’ve never driven a car that’s received so much vitriol from the public – and I’ve never been carved up quite so much on the motorway. I felt like a cheap Sunday joint by the time I’d reached my exit on the A1.\n\n## What about the interior?\n\nIt’s plenty spacious enough, but I struggled to accept the lack of buttons. The cabin’s an ergonomic nightmare. Everything is controlled by the touchscreen, which is ludicrous for a species that’s largely outlawed the use of mobile phones while driving.\n\nEven menial tasks, such as tweaking the steering column or adjusting the door mirrors, require you to tear your eyes away from the road and focus all your energy on the screen to navigate to the correct chapter in the library of menus at your fingertips. It’s dangerous.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: dashboard and infotainment system, black faux leather upholstery](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/061-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nWhat’s worse is the software running the touchscreen isn’t exactly foolproof. The safety assist menu on the right-hand side of the screen told me I’d been steamrolled by any wagon that came with 100 yards of the car, while Tesla’s half-arsed attempt at a native Spotify app couldn’t hold a connection long enough to make it through half a Tool song.\n\nThe climate control system got right on my napper, as well. Not only do you need to faff about with the screen to get it work, it’s also ridiculously loud. Even on its lowest setting, it sounded like I was sat on the business end of the Farnborough Wind Tunnel. At least the roaring road noise drowns it out once you’re up to speed.\n\n![Tesla Model Y (2025) review: front seats, dashboard and infotainment system, black faux leather upholstery](https://car-images.bauersecure.com/wp-images/13297/062-tesla-model-y-facelift.jpg)\n\nCredit where it’s due, though, the Model Y’s new centre console is more useful than the old car’s. It has far more storage space and it feels slightly better quality. I’m also pleased it has a proper indicator stalk rather than the idiotic steering wheel buttons you’ll find on the Model 3. But these merits aren’t enough to save the day.\n\n## Before you buy\n\nDon’t. Tesla’s _technology_ might still be at the cutting edge, but all the Model Y’s rivals – such as the [BMW iX2](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw/ix2-suv/), [Hyundai Ioniq 5](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/hyundai/ioniq-5-hatchback/), [Kia EV6](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/kia/ev6/), [Skoda Enyaq Coupe](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/skoda/enyaq-coupe/) and [Polestar 2](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/polestar/2-electric-car/) – are better _cars_. Tesla’s become so focused on producing a dazzling show stand for the Consumer Electronics Show that it’s forgot its primary purpose is to build vehicles.\n\nThe Model Y’s ergonomics are seriously compromised by the touchscreen, while its ride and handling can’t stand up to any of its competitors. Even in standard guise, the Kia EV6 is far more composed and much more playful – and if you lined a Model Y AWD up alongside an Ioniq 5 N, the Korean Korner Killer would chew the Tesla up and spit its fancy battery technology all over the tarmac. It’s no competition for me.\n\n## Verdict\n\nI’m sure there’s a good car hiding in here somewhere. Like I keep saying, Tesla’s battery and motor technology are right at the pointy end of the class – and its Supercharger network is still the most convenient way of topping up an EV on the move. But the revised Model Y feels unfinished to me.\n\nAnd the thing is, I don’t think it’d take very much to make it competitive again. Tesla just needs to employ a few more engineers who prefer tinkering with steering and suspension settings rather than fiddling with iPads and Linux. If the ride and refinement was better, I’d have more of a reason to recommend it – but it was awful.\n\nThe difficulty of interacting with the cabin was the final nail in the coffin. It’s all too easy to stray out of your lane while digging for the correct menu on the touchscreen – and that means putting your life in the hands of Tesla’s driver assistance technology which, as plenty of online crash reports testify, isn’t foolproof.\n\nFor the love of capitalism, Musk. Fix the chassis and put some sodding buttons in it.\n\n### Specs\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Price when new: | £51,990 |\n| On sale in the UK: | Now |\n| Engine: | Two electric motors,

It’s like the popular, lazy kid at school who’s had a bit of a wake-up call and finally started trying in their academic pursuits too.\n\nThe most obvious change is the exterior styling, though to be honest this is one of the more underwhelming modifications. The new Model Y looks wider than before thanks to narrow, flat headlights - but Tesla’s added full-width lightbars at the front and rear, which combined with the car’s slightly amorphous shape means it looks pretty anonymous. Certainly if you took the Tesla badges off you wouldn’t bat an eyelid at being told it was an electric SUV from a new Chinese brand.\n\n### Tesla Model Y: electric range, battery and charging data\n\n**Range:** 311 / 353 / 387 miles\n\n**Battery size:** 63kWh / 83kWh\n\n**Max charge speed:** 250kW\n\n**Charge time AC:** 8hrs 15mins, 0-100%, 11kW\n\n**Charge time DC:** 27mins, 0-80%, 250kW\n\n**Charge port location:** Left rear\n\n**Power outputs:** 275hp / 304hp / 370hp\n\nInside, the improvements are subtler but much more impactful. There are new, more comfortable seats all round, and improved sound deadening makes it much quieter to drive. It’s still dominated by a huge 15.4-inch touchscreen which controls nearly all the interior functions. Technophobes, look away - but unlike the smaller Tesla Model 3 you do at least get an indicator stalk, rather than having to use buttons on the steering wheel.\n\nInterior quality has also taken an uplift, and is really impressive. Not everything feels totally solid - the lower portion of the centre console sounds quite hollow, for example - but even where there are cheaper plastics they’re all wrapped in artificial leather, meaning you’ll barely find an inch of nasty, scratchy material. You can’t say that about most alternatives.\n\nThe Model Y is still superbly practical, too. The boot is huge at 854 litres in capacity (measured up to the roof - but it’s still bigger than most alternatives under the parcel shelf too) and there’s lots of space in the back seats. It helps that the Model Y is physically quite a large car - on some UK roads it can feel very wide, and you’ll want to watch your alloys when you’re parking in tight spaces.\n\n> The new Model Y is a big improvement\n\nAll Model Ys come with loads of tech, some of which is market-leading - while others are just needlessly complicated. The assisted driving features are a bit like this, as they’re very clever but in some situations on UK roads they just don’t work well enough to be worth using.\n\nWhen it comes to range and charging, the Model Y performs extremely well. Even the basic model gets 311 miles of range according to official tests, while the long-range car has a massive 387 miles. Performance is seriously strong, too, and you’ll leave many EV SUV alternatives in the dust at the traffic lights.\n\nInterested?

And remember that Carwow can even help you to [sell your old car](https://www.carwow.co.uk/sell-my-car) when the time comes.\n\nThe Tesla Model Y has a RRP range of £44,990 to £61,000.\nPrices start at £44,990 if paying cash.\nMonthly payments start at £488.\n\nOur most popular versions of the Tesla Model Y are:\n\n| Model version | Carwow price from |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Standard Range RWD 5dr Auto | £44,990 | [Compare offers](https://quotes.carwow.co.uk/car_configuration/choose-options?cap_derivative_id=107213&derivative_version_id=car_107213_2025-04-04&doors=Front+%26+Rear&engine_name=RWD+Auto&fuel=Electric&make=tesla&model=model-y-2025&transmission=Automatic) |\n\nThe new Model Y starts at just under £45,000 for the standard range, rear-wheel drive model. That’s pricier than a basic Hyundai Ioniq 5 or Kia EV6, but with a spec and range comparable to their middle-rung versions, and it’s a physically larger car - so not bad value.\n\nGo up the range to the £49,000 Long Range model or the £52,000 all-wheel drive variant and it becomes less comparable to those alternatives, but with the newly posh interior you no longer feel like you’re paying over the odds for a cheaply built car.\n\n1/3\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, interior driving shot](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P-f3dAxsiBwahb_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--7.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, front three quarter view driving](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P-gXdAxsiBwahd_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--9.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, front view driving](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P-gHdAxsiBwahc_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--8.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n_**Fast and much more comfortable than before - but in some ways feels more like a computer game than a car**_\n\n### In town\n\nThe Model Y feels like a big car to drive around town. It’s significantly longer, and a bit taller and wider than the already-large Hyundai Ioniq 5, and you notice that when trying to squeeze through small gaps or park in tight spaces.\n\nThe turning circle is reasonable, but visibility is compromised by thick windscreen pillars and a positively tiny back window - with no option for a digital rear-view mirror like you get on some alternatives. As a result you’ll find yourself relying on the Model Y’s glut of cameras and sensors quite a lot - so it’s good news that they’re excellent, providing a really clear view of what’s going on around you.\n\nThe Model Y has quite firm suspension, so you do feel speed bumps and potholes more than you would in an Audi Q4 e-tron. But it’s a huge improvement over the outgoing model - which felt as though it had suspension made of wood - and on a par with sportier alternatives like the Kia EV6, so it’s not really a problem.\n\nOne quirk is that the Model Y’s indicators aren’t self-cancelling in the traditional sense - they turn themselves off when the car detects you’ve finished your manoeuvre, based on reading road marks and the environment. This takes some getting used to.\n\n### On the motorway\n\nPerformance is exceptional, with even the base model capable of going from 0-60mph in just 5.6s - that makes getting up to motorway speeds effortless. The firm suspension feels quite settled on the motorway, too, though you do notice expansion joints or rumble strips more than in a Hyundai Ioniq 5.\n\nWhen you’re up to speed, wind noise is a bit more noticeable than in alternatives, but it’s not too obtrusive - and obviously there’s no engine noise to worry about. Tesla’s assisted driving features should really come into their own on the motorway, but we found the Autosteer function to be quite twitchy so stuck to traditional cruise control instead. We’ll update this review when we’ve had a chance to test out the latest version of Tesla’s Autopilot software - the closest to a self-driving car you can get on UK roads - however, in the past we’ve found this to be a bit buggy and better-suited to sweeping American highways than it is the UK’s pockmarked and confusing motorway system.\n\n### On a twisty road\n\nIt’s on a twisting road where you can feel that Tesla is primarily a tech company rather than a car company. The Model Y goes round corners competently, but even if you dial it into its sportiest settings it still feels like you’re driving a computer game rather than a car. It’s totally remote, with almost no feedback through the steering wheel or seat base.\n\nThis does mean it’s quite relaxing if you’re going at a more leisurely pace, but if you’re trying to have a bit of fun in the corners you’ll find it hard to judge how much grip you have. The upcoming Model Y Performance might improve on this, but for now the standard model is worth avoiding if you’re a keen driver - go for something like a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N instead.\n\n1/3\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, rear seat buttons in boot](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P-zXdAxsiBwahn_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body-.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, rear seats](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P-y3dAxsiBwahl_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--5.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, boot with all seats down](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P-zHdAxsiBwahm_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--6.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n_**Very spacious in the back seats and boot, but storage for smaller items could be better organised**_\n\nThe Model Y is a very roomy car, with a minimalist interior free of clutter. The front seats adjust electrically and should suit most sizes of driver, though even at their lowest you feel as if you’re perched very high up.\n\nIt’s also frustrating to control the mirrors and the steering wheel adjustment through the touchscreen. If you’re the only person driving the car, this is fine as you’ll only have to set it once, but if you share the car with a partner who’s a different size to you the beginning of every journey will be quite frustrating.\n\nStorage for smaller items is also a bit of a pain. There are a pair of wireless charging pads for phones just under the central touchscreen, which provides a convenient place to keep them - but if you want somewhere to sling the contents of your pockets, you’ll either have to use the cupholders or toss them into one of two very deep, dark storage bins in the centre console. It would be easy to lose things in there.\n\nThe glovebox is pretty tiny, and has to be opened through the touchscreen - quite annoyingly, it got stuck multiple times during our spell with the car.\n\n### Space in the back seats\n\nThe Model Y’s rear doors open wide to reveal plenty of back seat space, with a totally flat floor giving loads of room for people’s feet. The car’s width means three can sit across the back and not struggle with shoulder room as much as some alternatives, but the middle seat is notably higher and firmer than the outer two.\n\nThere are [ISOFIX](https://www.carwow.co.uk/guides/glossary/what-is-isofix-child-seat-connection) points on the outer rear seats and there’s loads of room in which to fit a child seat. Rear-seat passengers also get a 9.0-inch screen of their own in the centre to control their air-con and seat heating, which is a really posh touch.\n\n### Boot space\n\nWith 854 litres of space, the Tesla Model Y smashes the opposition on paper - even the roomy [Skoda Enyaq](https://www.carwow.co.uk/skoda/enyaq) has just 585 litres of space, while the [Audi](https://www.carwow.co.uk/audi) Q4 e-tron and [Hyundai](https://www.carwow.co.uk/hyundai) Ioniq 5 have 520 and 527 litres respectively.\n\nThe Tesla’s figure does involve loading up to the roof, though, so the space underneath the (slightly fiddly) parcel shelf is more comparable - but it’s still extremely spacious, and deep wells behind the wheel arches provide a good spot to stop smaller items from rolling around. There’s also ample underfloor storage perfect for keeping cables - that is, if you don’t want to keep them in the frunk, which is one of the largest of any electric SUV.\n\n1/3\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, rear passenger screen](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P_DXdAxsiBwaiB_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--2.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, steering wheel](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P_DndAxsiBwaiD_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--3.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y, RHD, silver, infotainment screen with screensaver](https://images.prismic.io/carwow/Z_P_D3dAxsiBwaiF_Tesla-New-Model-Y-2025-Body--4.jpg?auto=format&cs=tinysrgb&fit=clip&ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=60&w=1125)\n\n_**Minimalist design looks a bit bare - and while some functions work great, others are too fiddly**_\n\nTesla used to be known for its rubbish build quality - but the latest Model Y can put those complaints to rest. It feels extremely well screwed-together, and just about every surface you touch is either metallic or coated in artificial leather that feels high-quality.\n\nIf you go looking around you can find that underneath the leather there are definitely some cheaper plastics - the lower portion of the centre console sounds quite hollow, for example - but this is seriously nit-picking and can be applied to any of the Model Y’s alternatives. There really is very little to moan about in here from a quality standpoint.\n\nWhether you find more to complain about with the interior layout depends on how much of a technophile you are, but there’s no denying that for some functions, the touchscreen system doesn’t work as well as it could. The 15.4-inch display is bright and clear, and responds as quickly as any smartphone, but it can be tricky to figure out which of the many sub-menus has the function you want.\n\nThe Model Y’s speed is shown in the corner of the screen - as is the drive selector, bizarrely - which means you need to take your eyes fully off the road to see how fast you’re going.\n\nThere’s no [Apple CarPlay](https://www.carwow.co.uk/guides/running/what-is-apple-carplay) or [Android Auto](https://www.carwow.co.uk/guides/running/what-is-android-auto), but Tesla’s built-in apps include most of the functions you’d use on those anyway - and the Google Maps navigation software integrates seamlessly with the car to suggest charging stops when required.\n\nThe Model Y is a very efficient electric car, with an electric range to rival the best electric SUVs on sale but with a comparatively modest-sized battery. It gets almost 30 miles extra from a charge than the best Kia EV6, for example, with a slightly smaller battery capacity - and it’s a physically larger car.\n\nTesla’s excellent mapping software and access to the [Supercharger](https://www.carwow.co.uk/editorial/going-electric/ev-charging/how-to-use-a-tesla-supercharger) network of public chargers goes a long way to removing range anxiety, too.\n\n[Charging speeds](https://www.carwow.co.uk/editorial/going-electric/ev-charging) of 250kW are up there with the best, too, and Tesla says you should be able to add around 150 miles of range in 15 minutes at a Supercharger.\n\nAs an electric car, the Model Y pays the lowest rate of [road tax](https://www.carwow.co.uk/guides/running/uk-road-tax-bands-and-rates-complete-guide) \\- but all versions are over £40,000, so attract the expensive car supplement in years 2-5 of ownership. It does make an extremely affordable company car, though.\n\nThe new Tesla Model Y hasn’t yet been crash tested by [Euro NCAP](https://www.carwow.co.uk/guides/choosing/euro-ncap-scores-explained), but the old model scored incredibly highly when it was tested in 2022 - a five-star rating, with 97% and 98% scores for adult occupant protection and safety assist equipment respectively.\n\nThe new Model Y promises to carry on this enviable legacy with just as much safety equipment as before. We’ll update this once Euro NCAP has given its verdict.\n\nEarly Teslas had their faults, particularly with build quality, but it seems the brand has turned things around. In the [2024 Driver Power](https://www.carwow.co.uk/news/4678/most-and-least-reliable-car-brands-revealed) owner satisfaction survey, Tesla came second only to [Subaru](https://www.carwow.co.uk/subaru) in the manufacturer rankings, and its Model 3 saloon was rated the second-best car to own overall.\n\nTesla offers a four-year warranty with four years of breakdown cover included. That’s more than some premium brands, but [Kia](https://www.carwow.co.uk/kia) and Hyundai both offer longer cover.\n\n### Which Tesla is better - 3 or Y?\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 is smaller, cheaper, and better to drive than the Tesla Model Y, with a longer range. However the Model Y has much more space for passengers and luggage, and gets a proper tailgate rather than the saloon opening of the Model 3, making it better for families.\n\n### How much is it to replace a Tesla battery?\n\nReplacing a Tesla’s battery out of warranty is very expensive - more than £10,000 in most cases. However, it’s incredibly rare that this needs doing, and Tesla warrants the battery in its cars for eight years or 100,000 miles anyway.\n\n### Is Tesla Model Y considered luxury?\n\nIn some aspects, such as the technology and the performance, the Tesla Model Y is an alternative to luxury brands - but it’s too commonplace, inexpensive and not quite special enough to be considered a true luxury car.\n\nCarwow price from\n\nCash\n\n£44,990\n\nMonthly\n\n£488\\*\n\nReady to see prices tailored to you?\n\n[Compare new offers](https://quotes.carwow.co.uk/buying/car-configurator/payment-preferences?make=tesla&model=model-y-2025)\n\nRated **4.5/5**\nfrom **70,305** reviews\n[Trustpilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/carwow.co.uk)\n\n- [New Tesla Model Y deals\\\\\n\\\\\nCarwow price from\\\\\n\\\\\n£44,990](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/model-y/deals)\n- [Lease Tesla Model Y\\\\\n\\\\\nCarwow price from\\\\\n\\\\\n£488\\* / month](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/model-y/lease)\n\n![Tesla Model Y](https://deals.carwow.co.uk/image?filter%5Bangle%5D=side_left&filter%5Bbrand_slug%5D=tesla&filter%5Bmodel_review_slug%5D=model-y-2025&filter%5Bsize%5D=thumbnail)\n\n##### Configure your own Model Y on Carwow\n\n- Configure colour, engine, trim & much more\n\n- Receive offers from local and national dealers\n\n- Compare by price, location, buyer reviews and availability\n\n- Using Carwow is **100% free _and_ confidential**\n\n[Compare offers](https://quotes.carwow.co.uk/car_configuration/choose-derivative?make=Tesla&model=model-y-2025)\n\n## Popular Tesla Model Y colours\n\n- [Black Tesla Model Y](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/model-y/colours/black)\n- [Blue Tesla Model Y](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/model-y/colours/blue)\n- [Red Tesla Model Y](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/model-y/colours/red)\n- [White Tesla Model Y](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/model-y/colours/white)\n\n## Popular Tesla car types\n\n- [Tesla SUVs](https://www.carwow.co.uk/tesla/suv)\n\n\\*Please contact the dealer for a personalised quote, including terms and conditions.

The 2024 Tesla Model Y is THE electric vehicle right now (and really just Tesla’s brand as a whole). While I love how much they pushed car manufacturing forward, the question, as always, stands: is it family-friendly?\n\nIf you’re new here - welcome! I’m Kelly the Car Mom and as a mom of **four** ( [if you missed the life update click here](https://www.thecarmomofficial.com/family/car-mom-life-update)), CPST, and a huge car fan, I can’t wait to walk you through all the features of the 2024 Tesla Model Y to help see if it’s right for your family.\n\n[![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/10e047ce-eacd-4fd8-bfdd-4a48adddb0af/Graphic+How+to+save+at+the+dealership.jpg)](https://www.thecarmomofficial.com/courses)\n\n**_Before you dive in and start car shopping, make sure you’re fully prepared to tackle today’s market with confidence. To learn everything from dealership prep to a complete negotiations strategy,_** [**_check out my Car Buying Course_**](https://www.thecarmomofficial.com/courses) **_!_**\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y Highlights:\n\n- Two-row SUV with AWD and 310 miles of electric range.\n\n- Sportier Tesla model (much cuter in my opinion than the other options).\n\n- Same features across the board regardless of trim level. The only difference is in range and driving capabilities.\n\n- iPad-like infotainment system with great storage underneath.\n\n- Excellent second row head and knee clearance.\n\n- Second row bench has two lower anchors and three tether anchors.\n\n- HUGE trunk and a decent sized frunk (front trunk).\n\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y Overview\n\nThe Model Y is Tesla’s more popular, smaller SUV. It’s a two row SUV, with a third row optional, but I only have the two row with me today. Truthfully, I’m happy to just have the two rows because I’ve seen the third row of the Y and it is not functional for families or any adult passengers.\n\n2024 Tesla Model Y \\| An EV for families? - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of The_Car_Mom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj6V93txFbYZqsbL46Gc9mw?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thecarmomofficial.com%2F)\n\nThe\\_Car\\_Mom\n\n139K subscribers\n\n[2024 Tesla Model Y \\| An EV for families?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapqsgM6N2o)\n\nThe\\_Car\\_Mom\n\nSearch\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

It will be a much better bet for your family.\n\n### Price\n\nLet’s talk about the elephant in the room: price. The Model Y I’m touring today comes in at an MSRP of $49,900. This does include AWD, a range of 310 miles, and a ton of great features.\n\nYes, this price is expensive, but when comparing next to similar EV’s, the Model Y falls right in the middle on price (sometimes even on the lower end).\n\n### Charging\n\nCharging can be one of the biggest concern for families when looking into Teslas, or all EV’s for that matter. When you go to buy a Tesla, more than likely you will also be purchasing a typical 220 charger or quicker and have it installed in your home. garage to utilize as charging at the end of the day.\n\n![Tesla Super Charger](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/1cc64757-40e4-411a-b896-d88f284b2942/electric_car_1.png)\n\nWhen looking at charging on the road (road trips for example), Tesla has a Supercharger Network, which is the most advanced group of chargers out there right now. Every other manufacturer is trying to figure out how to make their cars adaptable to be charged on Tesla’s network - it’s that great. You’re talking about 55,000 across 6,000 locations.\n\nSo if charging is a concern, I’d recommend mapping where the nearest super chargers are around your house, in addition to getting a charger installed at home. This will guarantee peace-of-mind no matter what.\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y Exterior\n\nOne thing about Tesla, their exterior stays consistent. Even though this is the 2024 model, it looks practically the same on the outside as their 2022 model. I personally am a fan of how the Model Y looks. It has a sportier, sleeker look than the X. I think it’s darling.\n\nYou can definitely say no matter which Tesla you’re interested in, their exteriors have really pushed the remaining car manufacturers into a more sporty, high-tech route. It’s a much-needed change I personally love.\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y First Row\n\nBefore we break down the first row, let’s talk about how to actually get into the Tesla. If this was my personal car, I’d already have the app downloaded and just use it to unlock the car and set the AC / heater on. You will also get the option of a credit card that works like traditional keys.\n\nWhat I really like about Tesla is their trim levels (only three) vary in driving capabilities and range, but in terms of features, they are all the same across the board. This is so refreshing.\n\nAs for the interior, it is extremely simplified. While I like this clean look, I just know if there was one piece of trash in this car I would lose my mind. That being said, we’ve got a little bit of wood and chrome detailing, along with the faux leather, so it’s creates a nice and upscaled look.\n\nFor the size of the car, you’ve got some great center console storage. Charging capabilities are right below with two standard cup holders that work great.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about the gorgeous sunroof that extends almost the entire roof of the car. It truly brings in so much air and light, plus the head clearance is great.\n\n### Infotainment System\n\nThe Tesla Model Y is what I would call having the original iPad screen as its infotainment system. There is not a button in this car (except for the legally required hazards) - it’s all on the screen.\n\n![2024 Tesla Model Y Infotainment System](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/f277989d-b1bf-4739-9771-6ada5c771da0/tesla_y_1.png)\n\nWhile there is definitely nothing else like this infotainment system on the market, I’d say it’s pretty intuitive to understand. When I say everything is controlled through this system, I mean it. Things like opening the glove box, turning on the windshield wipers, these kinds of things are all exclusively controlled by the infotainment system.\n\nAnother note - there is no Apple Carplay or Android Auto. Instead, everything is an individual app, such as Apple Podcasts. I don’t mind this, but it definitely is different.\n\nFor those of you who are really technology-friendly, the dock never changes and all the controls between about a two button press away will be right up your alley. If technology and these kind of controls are not something you’re comfortable with, this infotainment system will not be for you.\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y Second Row\n\nJust a reminder, you can choose between getting just two rows in a Model Y, or adding a third row. While I do not recommend the third row (it’s incredibly small), today I will be focusing on the second row bench capabilities, since it’s the same in either option.\n\n![2024 Tesla Model Y Car Seat Set Up](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/3a6ded19-950a-4150-b29a-620f326a21ba/tesla_y_2.png)\n\nLooking at the bench itself, it does have a decent width, but this is not what I would consider a three car seats across machine. I tried a three across combination of seats I use the most (infant, combination, and booster) and was unsuccessful.\n\nWhat all of this means is that I would not recommend buying a Tesla Model Y with the hopes of doing three car seats across frequently. To me, this is a car that you have one child already, accidentally have twins, and from there could find a car seat combo that works.\n\n### Second row amenities include:\n\n- Great head and knee clearance\n\n- Comfortable seats\n\n- Nice wide and flat floor board (no big hump in the middle seat)\n\n- Two small vents on the console\n\n- Two charging ports\n\n- Two leather back pockets\n\n\n## Tesla Model Y LATCH Diagram:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/a759197f-2844-43ca-967f-25d2a0f3fdd4/tesla_y_latch.png)\n\n**Second Row LATCH:** two lower anchors + three tether anchors\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y Trunk and Frunk\n\nTesla basically invented the frunk (front trunk). Since there’s no engine, you can get a little extra space in the front - although it’s nowhere large enough to fit a stroller. I’ve seen families put leftovers, dirty diapers, or pretty much anything small that you don’t want to smell up the rest of your cabin.\n\n![2024 Tesla Model Y Trunk](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/d317c220-aa52-43af-a11c-210100758a67/tesla_y_3.png)\n\nAs for the trunk, it is HUGE. I’ve got a double Mockingbird stroller back here and there is still room to spare. There’s enough room for a Costco haul up top AND there’s storage underneath. You can fold down either seat in the back with a simple button press on the left-hand side and it works like a charm\n\n## 2024 Tesla Model Y Wrap Up\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this car! The drive, technology, and vibe is so different - but I kind of love it. If I’d have to recommend this car to a specific family, it would be for those with 1-2 kids looking to enter the electric market. This car offers a really good value for a lot of performance and tech.\n\n[![2024 Tesla Model Y Car Tour](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd8f86aa14a8970fe1a3198/e2595bc2-6ea5-41ef-ba58-44a0cc33a674/tesla_y_4.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dapqsgM6N2o)\n\n**_What do you think of the Tesla Model Y as a family vehicle?

With just the middle seat in the 40-20-40 second row folded down, we were able to fit all 4 of us plus 2 surfboards down the middle comfortably.\n\n[![Middle seat of a Model Y second row folded down at Everything Electric. Image: Tim Eden](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Model-Y-second-row.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1)](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Model-Y-second-row.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1) Middle seat of a Model Y second row folded down at Everything Electric. Image: Tim Eden\n\nRoof racks would still be a better option for taking surfboards on long trips or holidays as they take up a decent amount of boot space, but for quick trips the second row flexibility is a great feature and saves time tying things down.\n\nThe big front trunk (frunk) now includes a drainage hole with a plug at the bottom which comes in handy for throwing wet gear in, something we took advantage of multiple times with the wet weather we had over the weekend.\n\n[![Folding the Model Y seats and fitting a bike in was easy, wheels and all. Image: Tim Eden](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bike-in-Tesla-Model-Y.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1)](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bike-in-Tesla-Model-Y.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1) Folding the Model Y seats and fitting a bike in was easy, wheels and all. Image: Tim Eden\n\nFitting a bike in the back of the Model Y was also a piece of cake, with the back seats folded down I was able to leave both wheels attached and there was plenty of room to spare.\n\nFolding and unfolding the rear seats is also quick and easy with the electrically operated seats controlled via buttons in the boot. The front seats automatically move out of the way if necessary too, a thoughtful addition.\n\n## Even more efficient than the smallest EVs\n\nYou might expect the size and practicality of the Model Y to come at the expense of efficiency, but I was astounded by how little energy this car consumes. In fact, it was virtually on par with the Model 3 refresh which is the most efficient EV I have tested so far.\n\nOver a 265 km highway loop to visit the Kiama Blowhole south of Sydney, the Model Y used just 139 Wh/km. During trips through the city, efficiency figures were even lower at around 130 Wh/km. Driving conditions weren’t ideal either which makes it even more impressive, climate control was on the whole time and the roads were often wet.\n\n[![Model Y efficiency figures were impressive, just 139 Wh/km on the highway. Image: Tim Eden](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Model-Y-highway-efficiency.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1)](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Model-Y-highway-efficiency.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1) Model Y efficiency figures were impressive, just 139 Wh/km on the highway. Image: Tim Eden\n\nTo put this efficiency into perspective, I compared it against the smallest EVs I have reviewed and it beats them all: [Fiat 500e](https://thedriven.io/2023/10/27/fiat-500e-review-electric-italian-city-car-is-cute-but-has-some-faults/#:~:text=During%20city%20driving%20I%20observed%20energy%20usage%20of%2014.2%20kWh/100%20km%2C%20and%20for%20a%20171%20km%20highway%20loop%20the%20figure%20was%2015.8%20kWh/100%20km.)

(155 Wh/km city, 161 Wh/km highway).\n\nThe Model Y is also much more efficient than similarly sized SUVs like the [Kia EV5](https://thedriven.io/2024/10/23/kia-ev5-test-drive-a-quality-smaller-electric-suv-for-half-the-price-of-its-people-mover/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20worst%20leg%20I%20observed%20used%20193%20Wh/km%20while%20travelling%20mainly%20uphill%20with%20lots%20of%20sharp%20corners%20in%20an%20Air%20Long%20Range.%20On%20the%20way%20back%20from%20Bowral%20to%20Sydney%20in%20an%20Earth%20AWD%20we%20consumed%20163%20Wh/km.)

(171 Wh/km city, 188 Wh/km highway) and [Kia EV6 GT](https://thedriven.io/2024/03/26/kia-ev6-gt-review-one-of-the-best-performance-cars-on-the-road/#:~:text=The%20car%20consumed%2019.9%20kWh/100%20km%20on%20the%20highway%20and%2019.8%20kWh/100%20km%20around%20town.) (198 Wh/km city, 199 Wh/km highway).\n\nIf you are charging your EV with excess solar electricity then you may not think twice about the cost, but the energy savings become significant over the lifetime of the vehicle.\n\nAssume the Model Y will consume an average of 140 Wh/km compared to another electric SUV using an average of 175 Wh/km, both travel 15,000 km per year. The difference in total energy consumption in one year adds up to 525 kWh, or 5.25 MWh over 10 years, which is roughly the average age of Australia’s vehicle fleet.\n\n## Incredibly well rounded, but still room for improvement\n\nThe new Model Y does so many things incredibly well, from superb ride and handling, quiet and comfortable cabin, a [goosebump level sound system](https://thedriven.io/2024/04/08/bmw-i5-m60-review-the-sound-system-is-so-good-it-gave-me-goosebumps/) to rival much more expensive cars, smooth and simple driving experience, to the practicality, spaciousness and unbelievable efficiency described above.\n\nAfter returning the All-Wheel Drive, I test drove a Rear-Wheel Drive version to see how much of the overall package filters down to the base model. I was pleased to find the gap between these two variants was close, apart from the 84 km drop in WLTP range.\n\nOn paper the RWD is 1.1 seconds slower from 0-100 km/h, but still feels quick enough, while the updated suspension feels just as good. The base sound system lacks the clarity and punch of that in the AWD, although it still sounds better than many other cars.\n\nThis well rounded package is what makes the Model Y one of the best EVs on the market today. No car is perfect though, and the new Model Y falls short in one key area that is increasingly becoming a must have on EV buyer’s checklists – bidirectional charging.\n\nWhen so many other EVs, including the cheapest models from brands like MG, BYD, Kia and Hyundai offer vehicle to load (V2L), this feature omission from Tesla is becoming less and less excusable in my opinion.\n\nRumour is that Tesla vehicles built since the Powerwall 3 was released contain the same inverter hardware, and are therefore capable of bidirectional AC charging. Manufacturers of some DC based vehicle to grid (V2G) chargers also claim to have successfully tested Tesla vehicles with their products, such as RedEarth as shown below.\n\n[![List of EVs tested with RedEarth V2G charger, Tesla included. Source: RedEarth](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RedEarth-V2G-compatibility-with-Tesla.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1)](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RedEarth-V2G-compatibility-with-Tesla.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1) List of EVs tested with RedEarth V2G charger, Tesla included. Source: RedEarth\n\nHowever, Tesla remains tight-lipped about bidirectional charging support on any of their vehicles, so I would not count on it being officially supported unless they announce something concrete in the future. Even if something is announced, it is probably best taken with a grain of salt given Tesla’s track record on Full Self Driving timelines.\n\nApart from lack of bidirectional charging, I found the lack of a gear selector stalk is a step backwards from older Teslas. Unlike the refreshed Model 3 where both stalks were removed, the new Model Y retains an indicator stalk, leaving gear changes to the central touchscreen or physical buttons above the rear view mirror.\n\n[![Tesla’s Auto Shift feature guides you with on screen hints. Image: Tim Eden](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Auto-Shift-hints.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1)](https://b2232832.smushcdn.com/2232832/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Tesla-Auto-Shift-hints.webp?lossy=1&strip=0&webp=1) Tesla’s Auto Shift feature guides you with on screen hints.

On screen hints guide you in the right direction, although I still found it much slower and less intuitive than the physical gear selector stalk in my own car.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, I came away very impressed with the new Model Y. Tesla have successfully replicated the widespread improvements found on the Model 3 refresh last year to their best selling vehicle and made it even more compelling.\n\nI am unsure whether or not the new Model Y is capable of reversing the decline in Tesla sales as the Tesla fanbase is hoping for, especially with growing competition from new models. We will ultimately find out in a few months time anyway as production of the new Model Y ramps up and the initial delivery wave subsides.\n\nAt the time of writing, Tesla is also offering $9,000 discounts off pre-refresh Model Y inventory, although they only seem to have stock of Long Range All-Wheel Drive variants. If you are happy to forgo the improvements found on the new version, you can potentially save thousands and get into a long range AWD model for just under $70,000 driveaway.\n\n## Table of key specifications for the Model Y\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Variant** | **Rear Wheel Drive** | **Long Range All-Wheel Drive** |\n| Starting price, plus on-road costs | $58,900 | $68,900 |\n| Paint colours and options | 5 colour options:<br>- Pearl White Multi-Coat – included<br>- Glacier Blue – $2,300<br>- Stealth Grey – $2,300<br>- Quicksilver – $2,600<br>- Ultra Red – $2,600<br>Other options:<br>- 20” Helix 2.0 wheels – $2,400<br>- Black and White interior – $1,500<br>- Enhanced Autopilot – $5,100<br>- Full Self-Driving Capability – $10,100 |\n| Battery size, estimated | 60 kWh | 80 kWh |\n| Battery chemistry | Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) | Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) |\n| Range, WLTP | 466 km | 551 km |\n| Driven wheels | Rear-wheel drive | All-wheel drive |\n| Maximum charging speed | 175 kW DC, 11 kW AC | 250 kW DC, 11 kW AC |\n| Supercharge in 15 minutes | Up to 238 km | Up to 283 km |\n| Bidirectional charging | No |\n| Exterior dimensions | Length: 4,790 mm<br>Width: 2,129 mm<br>Height: 1,624 mm<br>Wheelbase: 2,890 mm<br>Ground clearance: 167 mm |\n| Kerb mass | 1,921 kg | 1,992 kg |\n| Storage space | Frunk: 116 L<br>Boot, rear seats up: 822 L<br>Boot rear seats folded: 2,022 L |\n| Service interval | Condition based servicing |\n\n[_Want the latest EV news delivered straight to your inbox?

For a while now, it’s offered a nearly unbeatable combination of range, tech features, pricing, practicality and outright performance—always the top target in the electric vehicle space.\n\nBut times change. When the Model Y was launched almost five years ago in 2020, its rivals—if you could even call them that—were the likes of the [Jaguar I-Pace](https://insideevs.com/news/727096/jaguar-ipace-ev-production-end/) and [Audi E-Tron](https://insideevs.com/news/343780/audi-e-tron-gets-lower-than-expected-204-mile-epa-range-rating/). These days Tesla no longer has the EV tech lead it once had over traditional automakers, which have not only caught up but also surpassed it in some areas.\n\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nback\n\nSign upFor more information, read our\n\n[Privacy Policy](https://accounts.motorsportnetwork.com/legal/privacy-policy) and [Terms of Use](https://insideevs.com/info/terms-of-use/).\n\nWe’re far beyond the point when buying a midsize electric crossover that wasn’t a Model Y incurred some kind of big compromise, be it range, price or both. Meanwhile, the Model Y has long been overdue for some upgrades to compete in a field that it helped create.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nNow, it gets them. Enter [the Model Y “Juniper.”](https://insideevs.com/news/746817/tesla-model-y-refresh-revealed/) This update addresses some of the old car’s biggest problems, improves the overall package in countless ways, and brings a new visual language to mark Tesla’s next era.\n\nIt packs more electric range, a dramatically improved interior and some clever new tech features that the rest of the pack isn’t even trying yet. It’s better equipped with things like standard heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats and rear-seat entertainment. I tested it in Dual Motor Long Range and came away deeply impressed.\n\nYet even after almost 2.4 million units sold since launch, the Model Y is facing what is shaping up to be its most difficult year ever.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n_( **Full Disclosure:** Tesla’s European arm loaned me a fully-charged Model Y Launch Series for 48 hours.)_\n\nTwo things are objectively true right now. The first is that the Model Y is an incredibly important car to the entire auto industry. It is likely to remain the benchmark for electric crossovers—at least outside of China—for some years to come.\n\nThe second is that the new Model Y launches under a cloud. People all over the world are angry with Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk. I won’t recap why in this review; [you’ve read the headlines](https://insideevs.com/news/753055/elon-musk-share-price-down/), [including](https://insideevs.com/features/748217/musk-ev-future-jan-20/) [here](https://insideevs.com/news/751777/tesla-takeover-alex-winter-interview/). My goal is to evaluate this EV solely on its own merits. What you do with this information is up to you.\n\nBut I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that here because it does speak to the test facing the Model Y: is it good enough that it might make electric crossover buyers get over their averse feelings toward the company boss? Or will that alone keep the Model Y from being a best-seller yet again?\n\nPurely on its own merits, it deserves to keep its crown—but whether it can is an open question.\n\nCyber Makeover\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nWhether you like the exterior makeover or not, the Juniper refresh makes the Model Y look more modern and easier on the eye. The front end now borrows the light bar design from the [Cybercab](https://insideevs.com/news/736879/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-reveal/), and the bumper is a bit more aggressive than before, featuring slats on the side that are open and serve an aerodynamic purpose.\n\nThe side profile looks almost the same as before, but the nose is a bit sharper and more aggressive-looking. You’ll also spot new wheel designs like the 19-inch set that was on my special Launch Series tester. You can also get 20-inch Helix 2.0 wheels, which look considerably sportier, but they make the range drop by around 20 miles.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nFor the rear of [the Juniper](https://insideevs.com/reviews/724281/tesla-model-y-juniper-update/), Tesla reserved what is considered to be a premiere for the automotive industry: a full-width light bar that projects its light onto a panel below it. You don’t see the source of the light, which is hidden, but what you do see is the diffuse light it emits onto a panel below, and it looks really cool and unique—it paints with light. This reminded me of architectural lighting and how that has the power to transform and beautify a building facade, and it does the same for the Model Y’s rear fascia.\n\nThe rear also has a redesigned rear bumper, which has a bigger diffuser-type element on the bottom, making it look like a Performance model. The impression that you’re looking at the Performance could be further strengthened by the presence of the Launch Series badge on the rear, which is similar to what you find on the trunk lid of [the hot variant of the Model 3](https://insideevs.com/reviews/753213/tesla-model-3-performance-euro/).\n\nOther improvements abound, [like the self-cleaning camera feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAytPwIwvk8) that blasts the lens with liquid to clear away dirt or debris. Anyone who’s had to wipe down their backup cameras during winter to see anything will love this feature, but it’s equally important to Tesla’s camera-based autonomous driving goals. Even if Full Self-Driving isn’t your thing, it’s useful.\n\n## Great To Drive, Now More Comfortable Too\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nThe revamped interior also makes a very good impression. Both the build and assembly quality seem to have been improved, and it still retains the original’s roominess and airy feel. The ultra-minimalist approach still permeates throughout the cabin, but it doesn’t feel like it’s forced or the result of cost-cutting (even though in some places that may be the case.\n\nYou sit quite high in the Model Y, higher than I expected, and you really feel this through the corners where the revised model’s more pronounced body roll becomes apparent. It’s a suspension setup that, unlike in the pre-refresh model, prioritizes comfort above sportiness.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nThis approach works better in a crossover than it does in the lower-slung Model 3, whose sporty character has been partially lost with the Highland update. If you have a sporty electric car itch, stick with the Model 3 Performance instead; it’s nimble and light and it rewards good driving.\n\nIt still shares the revamped Model 3’s suspension, which is softer than before and uses clever frequency-selective dampers. It feels even more comfortable than the Model 3, and there also seems to be a bit more suspension travel, making it glide over road imperfections with remarkable ease. Being on 19-inch wheels surely helps here too.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n## Power And Range Specs\n\nThe Model Y Dual Motor Long Range (which is what the Launch Series is based on) has a dual-motor powertrain that delivers around 370 horsepower and 363 lb-ft of torque, allowing for a 0-62 mph (100 kph) sprint time of 4.8 seconds, which is more than enough pace for any family crossover and it very quickly reaches its top speed of 125 mph (201 km/h.)\n\nPerformance feels effortless in the dual-motor Model Y, and because Tesla doesn’t provide any piped-in acceleration sounds, you often don’t realize how quickly you’re going.\n\nThe Juniper update made the Model Y run around 10% more efficiently so it can stretch its battery capacity further—it gets the same 78.1-kilowatt-hour pack with around 75 kWh usable as before. The WLTP range for the Germany-built Model Y dual-motor that I drove is 386 miles (622 km), up from 372 miles (600 km) in the pre-refresh model.\n\nThe U.S.-spec Model Y has an EPA-rated range of 327 miles and we’ll be driving one soon to see how close we can get to matching it.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nWith a fully charged battery, my tester indicated a range of 326 miles (525 km), which is good given the relatively low temperatures that dipped to around 41°F (5°C). One thing I noticed was that compared to the Model 3s that I’ve driven, the new Model Y’s battery thermal management system was much quieter than in the sedan, making it feel more refined and luxurious.\n\n## The Turn Signal Stalk Is Back, But...\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nNot all of the minimalist touches feel natural. One that does seem forced is trying to put on your high beams by pulling on the turn signal stalk, which Tesla added back in after catching flak for removing it in the updated Model 3. It’s quite strange to have a stalk and not be able to have high beams on it too, and you put those on via a button on the steering wheel, just like in the Model 3.\n\nIt is a stalk that allows you to put on your blinkers, but it’s as if Tesla wanted to intentionally make it bad. It self-centers after each use, just like in my old BMW E90 3 Series. Unlike in my car, though, where it has two clicks either way to get it to flash three times or put it on fully, it only has one in the Model Y, making it a bit more awkward to use.\n\nI also noticed that the self-cancel function is hit-or-miss sometimes, and I found myself moving it from one side to the other, struggling to get it to cancel. BMW did the self-centering stalk much better nearly 20 years ago, making it intuitive and easy to operate.\n\nThe steering wheel is the same design as in the Model 3, but since it doesn’t have buttons for the turn signals, it’s slightly simplified. What is just as good as in the Model 3 is how good the steering wheel feels in your hand while you’re driving the car. It’s on the small side, but with the quick steering ratio and direct feel, it was for me one of the defining driving characteristics of the refreshed Model Y.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n## Software, Tech, Other Improvements\n\nThe front screen is still the main point of focus in a Model Y interior. It’s the same size, but it gets thinner bezels that make it look more modern and upmarket. It’s still one of the best infotainment screens on the market blending super-quick touch response with enough processing power to never stutter.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nDriving the Model Y, it became even more apparent than in the Model 3 that these cars could use a head-up display to project important information in the center of the driver’s line of sight. Embedding a small (even monochrome) display in the upper part of the dashboard serving the same purpose would have been great. The big aftermarket scene for driver’s displays for these cars should have been a hint for Tesla to fit one from the factory.\n\nI’m not a big fan of having to rely on cameras for parking in the Model Y, which doesn’t have any ultrasonic sensors. The camera-based system does a decent job most of the time but in low-light conditions when one or more of the cameras are dirty, relying on the system for parking isn’t very reassuring.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nTesla offers an Auto Shift feature that puts the car in either drive or reverse depending on the situation. This is meant to make the loss of the physical transmission stalk less noticeable and even though it’s still in Beta, it worked well enough 99% of the time in my experience. When it doesn’t work, swiping up or down in the corner of the screen isn’t bothersome and it quickly starts to feel natural.\n\nThe rear screen is also great exhibiting the same crisp graphics and smooth operation of the front display. It allows you to direct where the air flows or rear occupants and it works great in this role and it also serves an entertainment purpose too.\n\nYou can watch YouTube or Netflix in the back and the screen is just big enough to make it watchable. The only problem is that it’s placed way too low for comfortable watching—it needs to be 10 inches higher to properly work as a mini-TV in the back.\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\n## A Better Model Y, No Matter Who’s At The Helm\n\nLooking at the Model Y Juniper objectively, it’s hard to not take it into account when shopping around for a sporty electric crossover. Even though it now exists in a much more crowded and competitive market segment than ever, it’s still good enough to be mentioned among the best.\n\nIf you judge Tesla on the merits of its boss, then the Model Y may be a hard sell for many. If that’s a deal-breaker for you, there are plenty of other great electric crossovers out there, and we’ve tested most of them. You won’t go wrong with something like a [Hyundai Ioniq 5,](https://insideevs.com/reviews/751141/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-first-drive/) a [Chevy Blazer EV](https://insideevs.com/news/735376/blazer-ev-2025-lineup/) or something fancier like a [Genesis GV60](https://insideevs.com/news/746285/genesis-gv60-facelift-refresh-2025/) or a [Cadillac Lyriq](https://insideevs.com/reviews/729569/cadillac-lyriq-ev-review-2024/).\n\n![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\n\n2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\nPhoto by: Andrei Nedelea\n\nHowever, the Model Y drives so well, it comes so well-equipped as standard and gives you access to the best charging network out there—although not the best charging performance since it’s only a 400-volt EV—that it's hard to ignore.\n\nThere may be a world where Tesla’s CEO gets reined in or puts his focus back on cars. After all, plenty of brands have found ways to move past their own dark clouds. Maybe then, attention will shift back to the simple fact that the new Model Y is a good car.\n\n## Gallery: 2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)\n\n[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070607_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)\n\n50\n\n[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBqYRl/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070607_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/6Z4QbE/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070594_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/7Z3Qb6/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070611_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/BXyeb6/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070610_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/40xKbz/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070602_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/E6p3bv/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070593_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)[![2025 Tesla Model Y Launch Series (Euro-spec)](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9meQbb/s5/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec.jpg)](https://insideevs.com/photos/901737/2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec/#8070609_2025-tesla-model-y-launch-series-euro-spec)\n\nprevnext\n\nSource: Andrei Nedelea\n\nMore EV Reviews\n\n[![mercedes eqs sedan review](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)Mercedes-Benz EQS Review: Lessons From The Future](https://insideevs.com/reviews/753766/mercedes-eqs-sedan-review/)\n\n[![id buzz road trip michigan](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)I Took The Volkswagen ID.

I don't own a Tesla, but I have heard that insurance companies have increased the rates on Tesla owner because of increased vandalism.\n\nI am considering an upgrade and if I just compare price, range, charge time, acceleration and native NACS port the Teslas are compelling. It is true that almost any alternative has a better dash, at least in my opinion, but seems to come at a higher price and a trade off on key performance specs.\n\nHowever, the current politics is a concern and may eventually influence me to get adequate specs and pay more for a better dash and desirable features Tesla has not addressed.\n\n![MadMax95](https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/ev-coral-author-noface.webp)\n\nMadMax953 months ago\n\nTeslas are extremely popular because they are great cars, on nearly every objective metric: performance, safety, tech, value and best of all, they're simply fun to drive. The alternatives models all have flaws and usually cost a lot more.\n\nThe insurance for my M3 is very reasonable, since the extensive suite of safety and anti-theft features result in massive discounts, and the premiums are well south of $1k per year. No vandalism surcharge yet.\n\nThe Elon factor is on the buyer, but I think it silly to buy an inferior car simply because you hate the guy.\n\n![The Machinist](https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/ev-coral-author-noface.webp)\n\nThe Machinist3 months ago\n\nBuy the car you want.

Photos\n\nCars are a big talking point in my household. I have parents who are both lifelong car enthusiasts and a sister who also loves cars by sheer osmosis. So, please believe my shock when my mum and dad came home with the news in 2022 that they'd placed an order for a Tesla Model Y.\n\n**RELATED: [‘What I wish I’d known before buying an electric car’](https://www.drive.com.au/caradvice/electric-car-advice-what-i-wish-knew/)**\n\nThe Tesla was mainly purchased for my mum, who drives her cars into the ground by putting hundreds of thousands of kilometres on them due to the nature of her work.\n\nFor reference, she typically covers up to 250km each weekday, driving back and forth from Wollongong to Nowra for work.\n\nAt the time, it didn't make a lot of sense. Neither of my parents is particularly eco-conscious and they've previously favoured sporty petrol-powered cars, but after two years and a whopping 60,000km in the [Model Y](https://www.tesla.com/en_au/modely), their decision makes sense.\n\nThe Model Y, which my mum endearingly named the \"Meme Machine\", has been put through the wringer over the past two years.\n\nHere, they share their honest Tesla review from the perspective of two people who need their cars to truly go the distance.\n\n![‘I’ve done 60,000km in a Tesla Model Y – these were the highs and lows’](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_q:50,rs:auto:1920:1080:1/driveau/upload/cms/uploads/b55ce0c0-38d9-5263-bbec-5d3f64050000)![PhotoIcon](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_dpr:2,q:80,rs:auto:20:20:1/driveau/upload/cms/theme/icons_v3/Picture)+ 6 Photos\n\n## An honest review of the 2022 Tesla Model Y: Mary Dobie, New South Wales\n\nI bought the Tesla to replace my 2014 Peugeot 4008, which I had driven for 250,000km before the gearbox gave way.\n\nI wanted the Model Y because after we test-drove it, we really liked how it felt to drive. The performance and acceleration were miles ahead of what the Peugeot was like to drive, and the safety features were like nothing we had before.\n\nWe were also getting sick of paying nearly two dollars a litre for fuel at the petrol bowser. It just made sense to go electric with the trips we were making for work — driving from Wollongong to Nowra and beyond every day.\n\nWe were looking at an electric [BMW](https://www.drive.com.au/showrooms/bmw/) or even one of the [Polestars](https://www.drive.com.au/showrooms/polestar/) or [Volvos](https://www.drive.com.au/showrooms/volvo/), but they weren't available when we looked at the Tesla, and we just loved the Model Y.\n\nI think we have been through more than the average Model Y owner in Australia. I've had to get repair quotes, had flat tyres, driven it interstate many times, and even modified the car a bit.\n\nSince we just crossed over 60,000km, it's time to change the tyres for the first time. I haven't really been preserving the tyres by gently pressing the accelerator or anything, but I have been getting the tyres rotated every 10,000km, which costs about $80 and preserves the tyres' life well.\n\nThe tyres themselves were a bit of a shock in terms of price compared to the older cars I've owned. I was quoted $520 per tyre, so it was just over $2000 for all four to get the exact same as what came on the car.\n\nWe treat the Model Y as we would a petrol-powered car, taking it on road trips to Melbourne, Brisbane, Orange, Mudgee, the Hunter Valley, and everywhere else. We like to make it a challenge to use only free chargers, the ones you find in country towns at information centres and such.\n\nSince buying the car, our energy consumption has averaged around 14.9kWh per 100 kilometres, and we typically see around 350km of real-world range on a full charge given our driving is mostly freeway-focussed. Still, I can easily make it from Wollongong to Nowra and back without needing to stop to charge.\n\n![‘I’ve done 60,000km in a Tesla Model Y – these were the highs and lows’](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_q:50,rs:auto:1920:1080:1/driveau/upload/cms/uploads/167fbc83-ad1b-57ef-855d-7f6268050000)![PhotoIcon](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_dpr:2,q:80,rs:auto:20:20:1/driveau/upload/cms/theme/icons_v3/Picture)+ 6 Photos\n\n![‘I’ve done 60,000km in a Tesla Model Y – these were the highs and lows’](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_q:50,rs:auto:1920:1080:1/driveau/upload/cms/uploads/1b0a2a22-008b-55c7-a267-763a63050000)![PhotoIcon](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_dpr:2,q:80,rs:auto:20:20:1/driveau/upload/cms/theme/icons_v3/Picture)+ 6 Photos\n\nPreviousNext\n\nWe drove from Wollongong to Brisbane and back only using free chargers. This allowed us to see some really cool country towns that you wouldn't normally see. We used the app PlugShare to find where the free chargers were, so it was like a fun little game.\n\nOn the way to Brisbane and back, we stopped about three times each way for a 30-minute break when charging. It gave us a chance to go to the bathroom and stretch our legs because we would've been stopping anyway if we were in a petrol car.\n\nThe solar panelling on our house means we run the car for free entirely. We charge a four-bedroom house with a swimming pool and a car that is always plugged in when parked in the driveway, and we are about $1.50 out of pocket each day with our electricity bill.\n\nSo yeah, it costs $1.50 to power a house and travel 30,000km a year. If you didn't have solar, I think it would cost around $15 per charge, which is still better than the cost of a full tank of fuel.\n\nThere haven't been many downsides to Tesla ownership in general. The worst thing that happened to us was a branch falling on the car while driving in the heavy winds we had a few months ago. It dented the A-pillar and the front fender.\n\nThe repair cost in excess of $5000 – which our insurance covered in full – and there were only a small number of authorised panel beaters in Wollongong. When I did find one, they told me that if I were in Sydney, I would be waiting months because there's such a backlog of Teslas and cars that have been coming down to Wollongong to get repaired.\n\nOther than that, we haven't had any issues. We did get a puncture, which was easy to see on the tyre pressure chart on the dash. We were lucky to get to the tyre shop before it released itself of all of the air, and got the puncture repaired for about $100. We haven't had to get the car towed due to a puncture yet, but we have heard of it happening because there is no spare tyre.\n\n![‘I’ve done 60,000km in a Tesla Model Y – these were the highs and lows’](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_q:50,rs:auto:1920:1080:1/driveau/upload/cms/uploads/0d720fa9-f5a0-5333-ab86-1f3a58c50000)![PhotoIcon](https://media.drive.com.au/obj/tx_dpr:2,q:80,rs:auto:20:20:1/driveau/upload/cms/theme/icons_v3/Picture)+ 6 Photos\n\nWe love the car; I love how easy it is for me to drive, all of the special features and the updates that happen on the car. We always get excited when we wake up and see a new update with more features on the car.\n\nSentry Mode is probably one of my favourite features. It gives peace of mind if anything happens to the car while it's parked, and we even managed to catch someone who swung their door open onto ours and dented the door.\n\nWe aren't paying for any of the subscriptions because they don't suit us. We tried the Autopilot when we got a free trial, but it's not the same as the one you get in America. It's not really 'autopilot' because it doesn't change lanes, and it's heavily restricted here in Australia, so it's not really worth the money.\n\nBesides that, we wish it had more power and more performance because it could be a really fun car to drive, but then you would be eating into your range, so I think it's perfect as it is now. Maybe we will put a wrap on it just to protect the front from stone chips.\n\nAfter over 60,000km, it's still going strong. Despite being one of the most expensive cars we have purchased, it seems to have made its money back without the need for regular servicing, refills, or even just having the car at the mechanic for a day mid-week.\n\n## Tesla Model Y cars for sale\n\n[View all cars on Drive

My daily commute is 170km mostly on the Newcastle-Sydney M1. Have a lifetime energy consumption average of 15kWh/100km, first set of tyres lasted 92,000km and have done nothing else but change cabin air filter and windscreen wipers. Battery degradation is about 5%.\n\nOn the OVO EV plan that has an 8c/kWh tariff between 0000-0600 and 3 hours of free power between 1100-1400. My yearly electricity cost for 40,000km is about $400. Have been on one trip to Brisbane which required 40mins of charging time - but of course we used that time to take bathroom breaks and eat so it didn't actually take any longer than normal.\n\nVery happy so far!\n\nsee more\n\n[Show more replies](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default#)\n\n- - [−](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Collapse\")\n- [+](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Expand\")\n- [Flag as inappropriate](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Flag as inappropriate\")\n\n\n[![Avatar](https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/95/1126/avatar92.jpg?1604141694)](https://disqus.com/by/disqus_4L7PjdlPmG/)\n\nPeople pay for convenience, that is why EV sales have slowed below forecasts.\n\nLast year I bought a VW Golf GTI. Glad to see this similarly priced Tesla Y isn't any faster and my Golf sounds great unlike any EV. I will however do a test drive of the Model Y when I get a chance. Interested to compare the handling and steering.\n\nOther than being boringly silent, the big downer for EVs for me is charging them - that is simply inconvenience.

EV \"fuel\" cost is 1/6 of the cost per km compared to petrol when charging at home. Even if this lady does a small top up between Nowra and the Gong and pays much higher electricity rates using a public charger, it's still a huge saving overall.\n\nEven if you charge it from the grid at off-peak times, every 10,000km of driving will cost about $350.

Nobody take take to 10 minutes to fill up at a service station unless you buy something in the shop. 5 minutes tops for over 500km range and that includes driving in, filling up, paying the attendant and walking back to the car.

And some people actually like the sound of their cars EVs will never match that.\n\nsee more\n\n- - [−](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Collapse\")\n- [+](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Expand\")\n- [Flag as inappropriate](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Flag as inappropriate\")\n\n\n[![Avatar](https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/95/1126/avatar92.jpg?1604141694)](https://disqus.com/by/timfromsydney/)\n\n10minutes, 5 minutes who cares - call 7.5minutes so we split the difference x 52 times a year and that almost 7 hours. Big deal. ICE or EV - it's hardly going to make an impact on anyone's life. Best bit is you don't get fat buying 2 chocolates for $5 (insert laughing emoji here). It definitely isn't 5 minutes. There's always queues to either pay or fill up. Anyway like I said....\n\nI have an EV and a fixed wall charger. There's no extension cord to find. It's permanent. It literally takes 30s to plug it in.\n\nHybrids are fine but you still have the engine so what's the point.\n\nI have a Tesla Model 3 Performance. 0-100 in 3s. 1/4 mile in 11s flat. It blows your mind. No affordable hybrid even comes close. You'll never get this kind or performance from an ICE.\n\nsee more\n\n- - [−](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Collapse\")\n- [+](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Expand\")\n- [Flag as inappropriate](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Flag as inappropriate\")\n\n\n[![Avatar](https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/95/1126/avatar92.jpg?1604141694)](https://disqus.com/by/disqus_4L7PjdlPmG/)\n\nRecharging is an inconvenience. This Model Y costs about the same as a Golf GTI which has faster acceleration and a nice sound. Your car is very fast but makes no noise and costs $81k + on roads. Part of enjoying cars is their sound. Enjoy your Tesla but I am in no hurry to switch.\n\nsee more\n\n- - [−](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Collapse\")\n- [+](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Expand\")\n- [Flag as inappropriate](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default# \"Flag as inappropriate\")\n\n\n[![Avatar](https://c.disquscdn.com/uploads/forums/95/1126/avatar92.jpg?1604141694)](https://disqus.com/by/timfromsydney/)\n\nI get your point but I owned 4 HSV's before the Tesla so I know all about noise. People think (& I guess that includes you), the noise is what you really want. I realised it's the acceleration. Having that \"take your breath away acceleration\" is amazing and not having the noise doesn't seem like much of a loss. I do understand your point of view and can accept it.

You need to go into the settings first. Full Self Drive option in OZ adds auto stop at traffic lights. I can see many changes in the FSD software optioned cars with the updates. For example Actual Smart Summons is there but not turned on for OZ. So we're getting many of improvements are in the cars just without the FSD on city streets enabled in OZ\n\nsee more\n\n[Show more replies](https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=caradvice&t_i=3396473&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drive.com.au%2Fcaradvice%2Fhonest-tesla-model-y-review%2F&t_e=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_d=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&t_t=%E2%80%98I%E2%80%99ve%20done%2060%2C000km%20in%20a%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20%E2%80%93%20these%20were%20the%20highs%20and%20lows%E2%80%99&s_o=default#)\n\n- -

Don't make me laugh. It cost us $5500 to install solar when we purchased our EV. Our quarterly power bill halved and that included charging the car every evening and travelling on average 15000km a year. On our household power alone we are saving $1000 per year. Add the car at 27c per km which is the accepted average and thats another $4K saving per year so our solar was paid off in the first year.

However, Tesla's shine begins to dull the closer you look, and its attractive price tag loses its appeal as you notice the SUV's cheap-feeling interior and build-quality issues. It's closely related to the [Model 3 sedan](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-3), which recently received a comprehensive facelift that addressed these issues, and the Model Y is set to get the same upgrades for the 2026 model year. In the meantime, this version of the Model Y is offered in three configurations—Long Range RWD, Long Range AWD, and Performance—each with varying levels of driving-range estimates and acceleration performance.\n\nEV Buyer's Guide\n\nCar and Driver US\n\n![Playlist Back](data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" fill=\"%23ffffff\" viewBox=\"0 0 256

2025?**\n\nThis year, the previously available Standard Range battery pack has been discontinued. Tesla hasn't made any other major changes to the Model Y for 2025, but a significantly revised version launches as a 2026 model.\n\n## **Pricing and Which One to Buy**\n\nThe price of the 2025 Tesla Model Y starts at $46,630 and goes up to $53,130 depending on the trim and options.\n\n[![Recommended](https://www.caranddriver.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/check-circle-fill.074ad02.svg?primary=%25237ad69c)Long Range RWD\\\\\n\\\\\n$46,630](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-y-2025/specs/2025/tesla_model-y_tesla-model-y_2025/464494)\n\nLong Range AWD\n\n$49,630\n\n[Performance\\\\\n\\\\\n$53,130](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-y-2025/specs/2025/tesla_model-y_tesla-model-y-performance_2025/464493)0$10k$20k$30k$40k$50k$60k$70k$80k\n\n[shop used![](https://www.caranddriver.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg)](https://shopping.caranddriver.com/used-cars-for-sale/listings/tesla/model-y/year-2025/?postalCode=23462&utm_source=cd-site-link&utm_medium=model-pages&utm_campaign=model-overview&utm_content=pricing-which-one-to-buy&referrer_id=ZCAR000028279)\n\nBuying an electric car is all about driving range, and the Long Range RWD and Long Range AWD models offer up to 337 and 311 miles of range, respectively. We'd go with the Long Range with the single-motor rear-wheel-drive powertrain, which maximizes driving range. There are few ways to customize your Model Y and only a handful of exterior colors to choose from—most of which cost extra.\n\n## Want to compare the 2025 Tesla Model Y to other vehicles you're interested in?\n\nOur new compare tool provides a comprehensive, side-by-side look at up to five cars of your choice.\n\n[Compare Cars](https://www.caranddriver.com/compare/?trimIds=68138111f617407e339232bf)\n\nThis content is imported from Third party. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n[iframe](https://www.caranddriver.com/inventory/?year=2025&make=Tesla&model=Model+Y&bodystyle=suv&site=caranddriver&source=review-article&location=content&zip=23462&bg-color=F1F7F7&test-data=false#/lotlinx)\n\n## **EV Motor, Power, and Performance**\n\nThe Model Y lineup starts with the Long Range RWD trim that comes with a single electric motor making 295 horsepower. The Model Y's Long Range AWD and Performance models are more compelling for enthusiast drivers thanks to dual motors that provide a higher combined horsepower rating and all-wheel drive. While the Model Y offers impressive acceleration, it doesn't deliver the same level of driving satisfaction as the Model 3. The SUV body creates a higher center of gravity, which dulls the sharp edge of the Model 3's handling, and the Y's ride is considerably rougher over road imperfections as well.\n\n## **0–60-MPH Times**\n\nThanks to a generous _Car and Driver_ reader, we were able to test a 384-hp Long Range AWD, which zipped to 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds, a mere 0.4 second behind [**our long-term Model 3 sedan**](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a30209598/2019-tesla-model-3-reliability-maintenance/). The Performance model delivered an even quicker [**3.6-second blast to 60 mph**](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a36376244/2020-tesla-model-y-performance-by-the-numbers/) in our testing.\n\n[![2023 tesla model y performance](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/0.291xh&resize=980:*)View Photos](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g36376259/2020-tesla-model-y-performance-by-the-numbers-gallery/)\n\nMarc Urbano\\|Car and Driver\n\n## **Towing and Payload Capacity**\n\nThe Model Y is rated to tow up to 3500 pounds, but a towing hitch does not come standard on any of the SUV's trims.\n\n## **Range, Charging, and Battery Life**\n\nThe EPA estimates that Long Range RWD models offer driving range estimates as high as 337 miles per charge. The Long Range AWD offers up to 311 miles of range; the Performance model's estimated range drops to 277 miles. In our real-world 75-mph highway range test, the Long Range AWD achieved 220 miles, and the Performance model achieved 230 miles. But the latter comes with 20-inch wheels, a lowered suspension, a higher top speed (155 mph), quicker claimed acceleration, and a dedicated Track mode.\n\n## **Fuel Economy and Real-World MPGe**\n\nThe EPA estimates that the Long Range RWD model is good for 125 MPGe in the city and 117 MPGe on the highway, while the Performance model's fuel economy estimates are 104 MPGe city and 97 MPGe highway. The Long Range AWD model that we tested over [**our 200-mile highway fuel-economy test route**](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a32018270/how-we-test-cars/#hwtfueleconomydrivingrange) recorded just 94 MPGe, while the Performance model delivered a result of 98 MPGe. MPGe stands for miles per gallon of gas equivalent, [an EPA metric that estimates PHEV and EV vehicle fuel efficiency](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a31863350/what-is-mpge/). For more information about the Model Y's fuel economy, visit [**the EPA's website**](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml).\n\n## **Interior, Comfort, and Cargo**\n\nThe Model Y doesn't come with the larger [**Model X**](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-x) crossover's complicated Falcon Wing doors; its interior is largely free of buttons and relies mostly on a large infotainment display positioned at the center of an uncluttered dashboard. A heavily tinted, all-glass roof lends an airy ambiance to the cabin. The optional third row of seats adds a steep $2500 to the Model Y's price. This cramped two-passenger setup is of limited use as the two seats cannot comfortably fit adult-size passengers.\n\n[![2020 tesla model y performance](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/0.0638xh&resize=980:*)View Photos](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g36376259/2020-tesla-model-y-performance-by-the-numbers-gallery/)\n\nMarc Urbano\\|Car and Driver\n\n## **Infotainment and Connectivity**\n\nAccessing almost every function of the Model Y—from the climate controls to the speedometer—requires users to interact with the large, slim infotainment display in the middle of the dashboard. The Model Y offers the same [**entertainment functions**](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30151777/tesla-model-3-entertainment-features/) as the Model 3, including embedded Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube apps, as well as video games, all perfect for killing time while waiting for the battery to charge at the public charging station. Don't worry, Tesla locks drivers out of using these distractions while the vehicle is moving.\n\n## **Safety and Driver-Assistance Features**\n\nTesla's Autopilot driving-assist system comes standard on the Model Y. Despite its name, Autopilot is not exactly the self-driving feature the company claims. The same goes for the Model Y's optional Full Self-Driving Capability. All Model Ys still require the driver's attention and possible intervention. Still, these systems are useful for reducing fatigue on long highway drives. For more information about the Model Y's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( [**NHTSA**](https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings)) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( [**IIHS**](https://www.iihs.org/)) websites.

I just finished the first road trip with mine so I decided to write one up.\n\n### **Background** ​\n\nMy background (because I think that's important context when someone's judging something): I'm a software architect and sometime-entrepreneur who is also a car nerd. I follow the car industry _very_ closely and ~~probably~~ definitely drive people nuts because I am fascinated by the little details of how cars are designed and built...I've been a fan of Doug DeMuro's for years because I similarly love all the little quirks designed into cars and am always interested to learn the history/\"why\" something is designed a certain way. Even before Tesla showed up with their new way of doing automotive software, I would talk the ear off anyone who would listen about how car makers needed to modernize their approach to software. I used to fill notebooks with car drawings as a kid. I do autocross racing. My useless skill is that I can identify nearly any car built since the mid-1980s just by its headlight design. I've owned Dodge, Ford, VW, Honda, Kia, Acura, Lexus, BMW. And driven many more besides.\n\nWhy did I choose a Tesla? A combination of (1) the aforementioned software contributing to a better/slicker user experience, (2) styling suits me (both outside and in...mostly), and (3) value. I'd been eyeing an EV for a few years, and when Tesla dropped prices, plus the federal tax credit, plus my BMW 340i was starting to have electrical...gremlins...that no one could hunt down (German car tax), I decided it was time. In an ideal world I would have bought a Model S, but I just couldn't find an additional $45k+ of car there over the Model Y to justify it to myself.\n\nWhy a Performance model? Because...uh...zoom zoom? ![🙃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f643.png) My wife, however, has banned me from flooring it while she's in the car...it's too violent for her (would hate to see her in an MS Plaid). It's not our primary roadtrip vehicle so I'm not too concerned about maximizing range most of the time. And I tend to buy go-fast cars. So I ordered a Performance in Midnight Blue Metallic with a white interior and the tow hitch. No FSD. Ordered July 25, delivered Aug 12.\n\n### Initial Impressions​\n\nDelivery was fast and easy — love doing everything in the app. Fit and finish was pretty good, just a few very tiny chips in the front bumper (can hardly even see them unless you really stick your face in) and that was pretty much it. The local delivery center did a poor job prepping it though — polishing compound was everywhere and there was still sticky residue from shipping material on the bumpers.\n\nI will say, the paint quality is atrocious — the worst I've ever seen on any car I've owned. Splotches/weird spots under the clearcoat everywhere, scratches, a few nibs, even what appears to be a slight \"undersprayed\" area on the hatch (like it didn't quite get enough paint). Unlikely that anyone will ever notice it, and I'm not willing to risk them making it worse by repainting, but still it's disappointing. Truly terribly paint quality. My mid-90s Dodge — truly a paragon of quality manufacturing — had way better paint than this Tesla. I'm a reasonably good DIY detailer, but even after I did clay bar, a two-stage polish, and ceramic...the paint is just okay at best.\n\nAs for the car in general, it's pretty much everything I hoped it would be — quiet, fast, good-looking, slick tech (mostly), pretty good sound system, good UX on everything from walk-away-locking to the charging experience. Spacious (especially compared to my snug 3 series). Tons of storage for the footprint. The minimalist interior suits me — I'm a bit of a minimalist where possible in my life, I like things with clean lines and not cluttered, so for the most part the interior works for me. But I _do_ wish there was a HUD with at least some basic info (speed, turn signals). And ventilated seats. Really, really wish there was ventilated seats. It's hitting 107 heat index here this week in the midwest. I wish for that even more than CarPlay.\n\nThe ride in the Performance, while firm, is better than I expected (I didn't get a chance to do an extended test drive in a Performance because the Indianapolis Tesla center doesn't offer them for test drives — I just got to spend 5 minutes in a neighbors'). It's firm, but solid and (mostly) planted feeling. Many types of imperfections are reasonably well damped. It's over smaller imperfections that they still have some work to do...and when there's lots of small imperfections in a row, it does feel too busy. Drive this thing on a brick road like I did in East Grand Rapids and it sucks. But overall pretty good. I'll probably upsize the tire width when it's time to replace them and get a little bit more compliance out of a less-stretched sidewall.\n\nAnd of course it's stupid fast for a midsize crossover. The kids think it's hilarious. It's terrifying to think of teenagers driving these things. I was hooligan when I was 18 and borrowed my neighbor's BMW 540i for prom...and that thing was nowhere near as fast as a base Tesla these days, let alone a Performance model.\n\n### The Roadtrip — charging and Autopilot experiences​\n\nOn the 6th day of ownership, I took it on a 230ish mile (each way) road trip from Indianapolis to the Holland/Grand Rapids, MI area. Up on a Friday, back on Saturday. This was my first trip in an EV. I used the Tessie app to schedule an automation that changed the charge limit to 100% at about 5 am (from 80%), which got the car charged up to 100% before I left at 9am using my Tesla Wall Charger I installed in the garage.\n\nThe route, using the \"Drives\" I did over those two days mapped in Tessie:\n\n![1692717598396.png](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/1692717598396-png.967337/)\n\nI wanted to show a version of that map with the Superchargers that I used marked, but the charging map view in Tessie doesn't seem to be working.\n\n#### Autopilot..ish​\n\nOn the way, I tried out whatever flavor of Enhanced Autopilot/FSD I have on free trial (it's a HW4 car, so I don't have the latest FSD Beta, as far as I know)...I hang out on this forum too much and I still don't know what version of this service I technically have right now. Anyway, I turned on all the Autopilot options I could, and tried to use it. Observations from the trip:\n\n- A couple of times, it aborted a lane change (initiated by me with the turn signal stalk) halfway through...the car swerved and canceled for no apparent reason. Alarming.\n- Car's perception of things’ distance is jerky (like trucks) — is that truck next to me 5 feet away or 10 feet away? Dancing around on the screen.\n- Couldn’t handle some of the construction lane shifts even though they were clearly marked with both cones/barrels and fresh paint. Some it did OK.\n- Sometimes rode too close to the left line of my lane, close enough that I could tell the car next to me was feeling a little crowded.\n- The attention nagger (apply force to the wheel) seemed _totally random_. Sometimes it would nag less than 5 seconds after I engaged Autopilot, sometimes it would go nearly a minute with me not touching the wheel and it wouldn't do anything. On that note, this is annoying...a capacitive sensor would be way nicer, just to know my hand is on the wheel, instead of having to apply force to it.\n- The car would brake/slow down for yellow flashing intersection caution lights on US 31...far too much. It was dangerous because no one behind me is expecting me to slow down, and the car would decelerate quite suddenly (because it wouldn't \"see\" the lights until they were pretty close, relatively speaking, at 70mph). And then it seemed unsure if they were yellow or red lights sometimes.\n- There was one spot the car was convinced there was a traffic signal and slowed down, where there hadn't been a traffic signal for a year (it is being converted to an overpass). And this is on the main north-south route through Indiana, not some side road.\n- It was too slow to accelerate back up to the set speed after slowing down (because of a car in my lane or whatever). This resulted in me sitting in the left lane, _very_ gradually coming back up to speed after another car had moved over, and irritating the people behind me. And this is the midwest, where drivers aren't anywhere near as aggressive as they are in many coastal cities.\n\nAll in all, it was pretty disappointing. Other than being able to do lane changes when I signaled, it was no really better than the driving aids in our 2021 Kia Telluride. And in some ways worse (for example, the Telluride doesn't slam on its brakes when I get near yellow flashing intersection lights on the highway). It was _not_ relaxing.\n\n#### Charging​\n\nOn the way up, I drove around 70 mph for a lot of the trip. I made it to the Superchargers at Meijer in Holland, 221 miles, without stopping (it would turn out every charging stop on this trip was at a Meijer, by coincidence), and with about 12% remaining on the battery. So extrapolating, that would suggest a 255 mile range with the driving conditions that day. Not bad.\n\nWhen I arrived at my first charging stop (which was also near my destination), it was about lunch time, and I knew I was going to want plenty of charge for the around-town driving I was going to be doing the rest of the day in Holland, plus I needed to drive 30 miles to Grand Rapids for the night. So I let the car charge from 12 to 99% while I got some lunch and killed a little time. This took 1 hour and 2 minutes, and cost $28.86. I was a little surprised at how much it cost. That was actually about the same amount I would have spent on gas to go 230 miles in my turbocharged BMW which got around 34 mpg on the highway and drank $4/gal premium. And only a few $ less than what it would cost to cover the same distance in our big three-row Telluride that gets around 24 mpg at highway speeds.\n\nDid my thing, stayed overnight at a friend's (didn't bother to plug the car in at their house, it would have been a 110V outlet). Overnight the battery dropped 3% because I left Sentry mode on (and maybe also because it got a bit cool that night? Around 50F). Given what happened the next day with time constraints, in hindsight I should have asked him for an extension cord and plugged it in.\n\nOn the way home, I was a bit rushed because I had to be back home by 3:15pm at the absolute latest and didn't get out the door in Grand Rapids until about 10:40am. Normally a 4 hour drive, in a gas car that would put me home around 2:40pm. I knew I'd have to charge, but I didn't completely mentally build in enough fudge factor for the reality that the charging stations were not optimally placed for me to only charge at a low state of charge — thus my charging speed would be slower. PLUS, I needed to get home with a certain amount of charge because I had to run errands after getting back.\n\nOn this route, there's a Supercharger \"void\" of 125 miles between Benton Harbor, MI, and Kokomo, IN (unless you really want to detour far off to the other side of South Bend instead of skirting around the west side it). This really limits your charging options.\n\nSummary of the drive:\n\n- Leave Grand Rapids at 74%\n- Stop to charge in Benton Harbor (at a Meijer) at 35% -> charge to 76% (18 minutes, $12.87). This was as far as I could go, I wasn't going to make it to the next Supercharger otherwise.\n- Realize that if I drive slowly (65-70) I can make it home, but won't arrive with enough charge to run errands. So I'm going to have to stop to charge again, which will take time...which means I need to drive faster (80), so now I _definitely_ need to charge because driving faster is less efficient, which means I'll need to charge even _more_ to make up for driving faster. Weird damned-if-you-do/don't situation.\n- Stop in Kokomo to charge (also at a Meijer), 22% -> 55% (10 minutes, $10.73)\n- Arrived home at 3:07pm with 30% SoC, enough to run my errands for the rest of the day and finish the day around 14%.\n\nEvery Supercharger I used was a 250kW, by the way.\n\nSo that was an experience. And I learned I have to do my own math or augment Tesla's route planning with something like A Better Route Planner (which I don't like because it's buggy) if I have to arrive with a certain state of charge. Everyone around here says \"just set the destination and stop where it tells you\"...well, yeah that will get you there, but if you need to be charged when you arrive _and_ you're trying to arrive by a certain time...now you've got to think about longer/additional charging stops, the charging curve...things get more complicated. PLEASE Tesla, add an optional \"State of charge at destination\" parameter to route planning. This one addition, which could show the total travel time after accounting for a longer charging stop (and the associated charging curve), would be a huge quality of life upgrade.\n\n### Summary: Pros and Cons​\n\n### Pros​\n\n- The car feels great to drive. Smooth, powerful, handles reasonably well for what it is.\n- Love the ability to remote start the climate from my Apple Watch (using Tessie) from inside a store on a hot day.\n- It was very comfortable for the 4+ hour road trip. Seats were great. It was quiet. Music streaming and bluetooth via my phone of audiobooks worked effortlessly.\n- I am happy every time I get in it. The whole user experience is pretty good — removing little pieces of friction like having to lock/unlock, press a start button, turn the car off, the fact that _everything_ from the driving settings to the vent position is tied with my driver profile...it all adds up to an easy/seamless experience.\n- I no longer feel guilty if I need to talk a very short trip in the Tesla vs firing up a gas car. We live in a small suburb's downtown area, it's mostly walkable where nearly everything is within a mile or two of our house...but certain stores, while very close distance-wise, are not that walkable because you have to cross 5 lanes of traffic or it's just a little too far to want to walk when it's really hot.\n\n### Cons​\n\n- Enhanced Autopilot/whatever watered-down version of FSD my HW4 car is currently running is barely better than a joke. In its current form, it's not any better (and in some ways is worse) then driving aids that have been available on mainstream automakers' cars for 4 or 5 years now. I know Tesla's continuing to invest heavily in development, and I am open to re-evaluating when the newest version becomes available for my car. But right now, I can't believe people pay extra for this.\n- The parking aid/\"sensor\" functionality is also a joke, which I have ranted about in other threads. It's constantly off by multiple _feet_ and the car's interpretation of its environment is sketchy at best. Probably the worst instance was when it freaked out because it thought I was going to hit...a painted white line on the pavement.\n- Trip/charging planning isn't as powerful/flexible as I'd like it to be. You've got to do a fair amount of mental math and/or fiddle with third party tools like ABRP to make sure you can align desired arrival time _and_ arrival state of charge (which is buggy when it comes to setting target departure/arrival times).\n- Supercharging is expensive. Pretty much as expensive as gas, but is less convenient and takes longer.\n- Ride is on the firm side, too \"busy\" on certain surfaces\n- No cooled seats ![🥵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f975.png)\n\nI think that about sums it up! I may revisit/post an update after I've spent longer with the car. Like I said, I always found personal reviews interesting, especially as people adapted to an EV and thought about things they hadn't had to consider before (like in terms of planning roadtrips and stuff like that). So I hope this helps somebody.\n\nObligatory picture (pre-tint):\n\n![IMG_1279.jpeg](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/img_1279-jpeg.967345/)\n\n- ![Like](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nReactions: [RoBoRaT, dronus, Fairchild and 22 others](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/7779207/reactions)\n\nClick to expand...\n\n[K](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/konicom04.262062/)\n\n#### [Konicom04](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/konicom04.262062/)\n\n##### Member\n\nJan 14, 2023[518](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/search/member?user_id=262062)425[60007](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/misc/location-info?location=60007)\n\nFantastic review.

I transferred the FSD, but honestly I never found a use for it before. I never even cared for the lane keeping (too many micro corrections and doesn't handle variable curve corners well at all). I also absolutely hated the nagging. I'd keep my hands on the wheel but the car would never be able to \"feel\" it unless I jerked the wheel every 45 seconds or so. That was not a relaxed way to drive. But I figure some day it may be better so it was best to transfer it over. I still hold out some hope for when they enable the interior camera to determine you are paying attention and stop relying on you resisting the steering.\n\nAs far as relaxing compared to an ICE car - just try turning on only the TACC - Traffic Aware Cruise Control. When I went from a Toyota Camry to my Model S it totally changed my commute home. Previously I would get home mentally tired. After getting the Model S in 2017, I would arrive home not tired at all. Just the difference from not having to hit the brake, then the gas, then hard on the brake, then the gas all the time in the Camry made a world of difference. I am fine with doing the steering and any lane changes by myself. That TACC was really a game changer for me.\n\nI hope you continue to enjoy your Tesla. My wife (Model 3) and I certainly enjoy ours.\n\n- ![Like](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nReactions: [Dennisis, Eric33432, Ferengii and 2 others](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/7779676/reactions)\n\n[J](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/jbrady3324.101555/)\n\n#### [jbrady3324](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/jbrady3324.101555/)\n\n##### Member\n\nApr 20, 2019[158](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/search/member?user_id=101555)147[Chicago](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/misc/location-info?location=Chicago)\n\n> [Konicom04 said:](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/goto/post?id=7779303)\n>\n> Fantastic review.

The gap in driving tech has been greatly reduced. There are many owners who feel this way and many reports stating the same.\n\nHowever, for what it’s worth, Tesla FSD is better on city streets. And I think Tesla’s lane changing is better.\n\n[![gx9901](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/data/avatars/h/180/180552.jpg?1659384583)](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/gx9901.180552/)\n\n#### [gx9901](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/gx9901.180552/)\n\n##### Active Member\n\nAug 1, 2021[1,050](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/search/member?user_id=180552)1,348[St Paul, MN](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/misc/location-info?location=St+Paul%2C+MN)\n\nFun read!\n\nI've done one 800-mile roundtrip using FSD-beta subscription and two 400-mile roundtrips with normal Autopilot this summer, and didn't really experience any issues during those trips. I have experienced some of the AP issues described by the OP during my 2 years of ownership so far, but maybe because I have a certain amount of built in distrust for AP, probably from reading this forum too much, I'm always looking for potential failure points while using AP, so I don't end up getting into those situations very much in the first place.\n\nAs for the AP nagging, I have rarely experienced it after I developed a technique early in my ownership to rest my elbow on the armrest (either side) and hang my hand on the steering wheel spoke. I have only driven one car that has a capacitive steering wheel for hand detection, my mom's Audi fat etron, and frankly I prefer the torque senser because the Audi requires a tighter grip on the wheel for me to avoid it's nags. I get nagged more in the Audi than my MYP (which is pretty much never) when using their respective driver assist systems.\n\nI also would like to be able to set the destination SOC. That would be a good feature to have and hopefully can be provided via software update someday. I did find that it's good to at least mentally verify the car's SOC estimates as sometimes the SOC estimates can get out of whack for whatever reason.\n\nAnyway, I hope the OP continue to enjoy the MYP. I'm two years in and I honestly still enjoy driving it as much as I did on day one. Actually probably even more since its had many useful updates since then.\n\n- ![Like](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nReactions: [Dennisis and Ferengii](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/7780190/reactions)\n\n[K](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/konicom04.262062/)\n\n#### [Konicom04](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/konicom04.262062/)\n\n##### Member\n\nJan 14, 2023[518](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/search/member?user_id=262062)425[60007](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/misc/location-info?location=60007)\n\n> [gx9901 said:](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/goto/post?id=7780190)\n>\n> Fun read!\n>\n> As for the AP nagging, I have rarely experienced it after I developed a technique early in my ownership to rest my elbow on the armrest (either side) and hang my hand on the steering wheel spoke.

I just finished the first road trip with mine so I decided to write one up.\n>\n> ### **Background** ​\n>\n> My background (because I think that's important context when someone's judging something): I'm a software architect and sometime-entrepreneur who is also a car nerd. I follow the car industry _very_ closely and ~~probably~~ definitely drive people nuts because I am fascinated by the little details of how cars are designed and built...I've been a fan of Doug DeMuro's for years because I similarly love all the little quirks designed into cars and am always interested to learn the history/\"why\" something is designed a certain way. Even before Tesla showed up with their new way of doing automotive software, I would talk the ear off anyone who would listen about how car makers needed to modernize their approach to software. I used to fill notebooks with car drawings as a kid. I do autocross racing. My useless skill is that I can identify nearly any car built since the mid-1980s just by its headlight design. I've owned Dodge, Ford, VW, Honda, Kia, Acura, Lexus, BMW. And driven many more besides.\n>\n> Why did I choose a Tesla? A combination of (1) the aforementioned software contributing to a better/slicker user experience, (2) styling suits me (both outside and in...mostly), and (3) value. I'd been eyeing an EV for a few years, and when Tesla dropped prices, plus the federal tax credit, plus my BMW 340i was starting to have electrical...gremlins...that no one could hunt down (German car tax), I decided it was time. In an ideal world I would have bought a Model S, but I just couldn't find an additional $45k+ of car there over the Model Y to justify it to myself.\n>\n> Why a Performance model? Because...uh...zoom zoom? ![🙃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f643.png) My wife, however, has banned me from flooring it while she's in the car...it's too violent for her (would hate to see her in an MS Plaid). It's not our primary roadtrip vehicle so I'm not too concerned about maximizing range most of the time. And I tend to buy go-fast cars. So I ordered a Performance in Midnight Blue Metallic with a white interior and the tow hitch. No FSD. Ordered July 25, delivered Aug 12.\n>\n> ### Initial Impressions​\n>\n> Delivery was fast and easy — love doing everything in the app. Fit and finish was pretty good, just a few very tiny chips in the front bumper (can hardly even see them unless you really stick your face in) and that was pretty much it. The local delivery center did a poor job prepping it though — polishing compound was everywhere and there was still sticky residue from shipping material on the bumpers.\n>\n> I will say, the paint quality is atrocious — the worst I've ever seen on any car I've owned. Splotches/weird spots under the clearcoat everywhere, scratches, a few nibs, even what appears to be a slight \"undersprayed\" area on the hatch (like it didn't quite get enough paint). Unlikely that anyone will ever notice it, and I'm not willing to risk them making it worse by repainting, but still it's disappointing. Truly terribly paint quality. My mid-90s Dodge — truly a paragon of quality manufacturing — had way better paint than this Tesla. I'm a reasonably good DIY detailer, but even after I did clay bar, a two-stage polish, and ceramic...the paint is just okay at best.\n>\n> As for the car in general, it's pretty much everything I hoped it would be — quiet, fast, good-looking, slick tech (mostly), pretty good sound system, good UX on everything from walk-away-locking to the charging experience. Spacious (especially compared to my snug 3 series). Tons of storage for the footprint. The minimalist interior suits me — I'm a bit of a minimalist where possible in my life, I like things with clean lines and not cluttered, so for the most part the interior works for me. But I _do_ wish there was a HUD with at least some basic info (speed, turn signals). And ventilated seats. Really, really wish there was ventilated seats. It's hitting 107 heat index here this week in the midwest. I wish for that even more than CarPlay.\n>\n> The ride in the Performance, while firm, is better than I expected (I didn't get a chance to do an extended test drive in a Performance because the Indianapolis Tesla center doesn't offer them for test drives — I just got to spend 5 minutes in a neighbors'). It's firm, but solid and (mostly) planted feeling. Many types of imperfections are reasonably well damped. It's over smaller imperfections that they still have some work to do...and when there's lots of small imperfections in a row, it does feel too busy. Drive this thing on a brick road like I did in East Grand Rapids and it sucks. But overall pretty good. I'll probably upsize the tire width when it's time to replace them and get a little bit more compliance out of a less-stretched sidewall.\n>\n> And of course it's stupid fast for a midsize crossover. The kids think it's hilarious. It's terrifying to think of teenagers driving these things. I was hooligan when I was 18 and borrowed my neighbor's BMW 540i for prom...and that thing was nowhere near as fast as a base Tesla these days, let alone a Performance model.\n>\n> ### The Roadtrip — charging and Autopilot experiences​\n>\n> On the 6th day of ownership, I took it on a 230ish mile (each way) road trip from Indianapolis to the Holland/Grand Rapids, MI area. Up on a Friday, back on Saturday. This was my first trip in an EV. I used the Tessie app to schedule an automation that changed the charge limit to 100% at about 5 am (from 80%), which got the car charged up to 100% before I left at 9am using my Tesla Wall Charger I installed in the garage.\n>\n> The route, using the \"Drives\" I did over those two days mapped in Tessie:\n>\n> [View attachment 967337](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/967337/)\n>\n> I wanted to show a version of that map with the Superchargers that I used marked, but the charging map view in Tessie doesn't seem to be working.\n>\n> #### Autopilot..ish​\n>\n> On the way, I tried out whatever flavor of Enhanced Autopilot/FSD I have on free trial (it's a HW4 car, so I don't have the latest FSD Beta, as far as I know)...I hang out on this forum too much and I still don't know what version of this service I technically have right now. Anyway, I turned on all the Autopilot options I could, and tried to use it. Observations from the trip:\n>\n> - A couple of times, it aborted a lane change (initiated by me with the turn signal stalk) halfway through...the car swerved and canceled for no apparent reason. Alarming.\n> - Car's perception of things’ distance is jerky (like trucks) — is that truck next to me 5 feet away or 10 feet away? Dancing around on the screen.\n> - Couldn’t handle some of the construction lane shifts even though they were clearly marked with both cones/barrels and fresh paint. Some it did OK.\n> - Sometimes rode too close to the left line of my lane, close enough that I could tell the car next to me was feeling a little crowded.\n> - The attention nagger (apply force to the wheel) seemed _totally random_. Sometimes it would nag less than 5 seconds after I engaged Autopilot, sometimes it would go nearly a minute with me not touching the wheel and it wouldn't do anything. On that note, this is annoying...a capacitive sensor would be way nicer, just to know my hand is on the wheel, instead of having to apply force to it.\n> - The car would brake/slow down for yellow flashing intersection caution lights on US 31...far too much. It was dangerous because no one behind me is expecting me to slow down, and the car would decelerate quite suddenly (because it wouldn't \"see\" the lights until they were pretty close, relatively speaking, at 70mph). And then it seemed unsure if they were yellow or red lights sometimes.\n> - There was one spot the car was convinced there was a traffic signal and slowed down, where there hadn't been a traffic signal for a year (it is being converted to an overpass). And this is on the main north-south route through Indiana, not some side road.\n> - It was too slow to accelerate back up to the set speed after slowing down (because of a car in my lane or whatever). This resulted in me sitting in the left lane, _very_ gradually coming back up to speed after another car had moved over, and irritating the people behind me. And this is the midwest, where drivers aren't anywhere near as aggressive as they are in many coastal cities.\n>\n> All in all, it was pretty disappointing. Other than being able to do lane changes when I signaled, it was no really better than the driving aids in our 2021 Kia Telluride. And in some ways worse (for example, the Telluride doesn't slam on its brakes when I get near yellow flashing intersection lights on the highway). It was _not_ relaxing.\n>\n> #### Charging​\n>\n> On the way up, I drove around 70 mph for a lot of the trip. I made it to the Superchargers at Meijer in Holland, 221 miles, without stopping (it would turn out every charging stop on this trip was at a Meijer, by coincidence), and with about 12% remaining on the battery. So extrapolating, that would suggest a 255 mile range with the driving conditions that day. Not bad.\n>\n> When I arrived at my first charging stop (which was also near my destination), it was about lunch time, and I knew I was going to want plenty of charge for the around-town driving I was going to be doing the rest of the day in Holland, plus I needed to drive 30 miles to Grand Rapids for the night. So I let the car charge from 12 to 99% while I got some lunch and killed a little time. This took 1 hour and 2 minutes, and cost $28.86. I was a little surprised at how much it cost. That was actually about the same amount I would have spent on gas to go 230 miles in my turbocharged BMW which got around 34 mpg on the highway and drank $4/gal premium. And only a few $ less than what it would cost to cover the same distance in our big three-row Telluride that gets around 24 mpg at highway speeds.\n>\n> Did my thing, stayed overnight at a friend's (didn't bother to plug the car in at their house, it would have been a 110V outlet). Overnight the battery dropped 3% because I left Sentry mode on (and maybe also because it got a bit cool that night? Around 50F). Given what happened the next day with time constraints, in hindsight I should have asked him for an extension cord and plugged it in.\n>\n> On the way home, I was a bit rushed because I had to be back home by 3:15pm at the absolute latest and didn't get out the door in Grand Rapids until about 10:40am. Normally a 4 hour drive, in a gas car that would put me home around 2:40pm. I knew I'd have to charge, but I didn't completely mentally build in enough fudge factor for the reality that the charging stations were not optimally placed for me to only charge at a low state of charge — thus my charging speed would be slower. PLUS, I needed to get home with a certain amount of charge because I had to run errands after getting back.\n>\n> On this route, there's a Supercharger \"void\" of 125 miles between Benton Harbor, MI, and Kokomo, IN (unless you really want to detour far off to the other side of South Bend instead of skirting around the west side it). This really limits your charging options.\n>\n> Summary of the drive:\n>\n> - Leave Grand Rapids at 74%\n> - Stop to charge in Benton Harbor (at a Meijer) at 35% -> charge to 76% (18 minutes, $12.87). This was as far as I could go, I wasn't going to make it to the next Supercharger otherwise.\n> - Realize that if I drive slowly (65-70) I can make it home, but won't arrive with enough charge to run errands. So I'm going to have to stop to charge again, which will take time...which means I need to drive faster (80), so now I _definitely_ need to charge because driving faster is less efficient, which means I'll need to charge even _more_ to make up for driving faster. Weird damned-if-you-do/don't situation.\n> - Stop in Kokomo to charge (also at a Meijer), 22% -> 55% (10 minutes, $10.73)\n> - Arrived home at 3:07pm with 30% SoC, enough to run my errands for the rest of the day and finish the day around 14%.\n>\n> Every Supercharger I used was a 250kW, by the way.\n>\n> So that was an experience. And I learned I have to do my own math or augment Tesla's route planning with something like A Better Route Planner (which I don't like because it's buggy) if I have to arrive with a certain state of charge. Everyone around here says \"just set the destination and stop where it tells you\"...well, yeah that will get you there, but if you need to be charged when you arrive _and_ you're trying to arrive by a certain time...now you've got to think about longer/additional charging stops, the charging curve...things get more complicated. PLEASE Tesla, add an optional \"State of charge at destination\" parameter to route planning. This one addition, which could show the total travel time after accounting for a longer charging stop (and the associated charging curve), would be a huge quality of life upgrade.\n>\n> ### Summary: Pros and Cons​\n>\n> ### Pros​\n>\n> - The car feels great to drive. Smooth, powerful, handles reasonably well for what it is.\n> - Love the ability to remote start the climate from my Apple Watch (using Tessie) from inside a store on a hot day.\n> - It was very comfortable for the 4+ hour road trip. Seats were great. It was quiet. Music streaming and bluetooth via my phone of audiobooks worked effortlessly.\n> - I am happy every time I get in it. The whole user experience is pretty good — removing little pieces of friction like having to lock/unlock, press a start button, turn the car off, the fact that _everything_ from the driving settings to the vent position is tied with my driver profile...it all adds up to an easy/seamless experience.\n> - I no longer feel guilty if I need to talk a very short trip in the Tesla vs firing up a gas car. We live in a small suburb's downtown area, it's mostly walkable where nearly everything is within a mile or two of our house...but certain stores, while very close distance-wise, are not that walkable because you have to cross 5 lanes of traffic or it's just a little too far to want to walk when it's really hot.\n>\n> ### Cons​\n>\n> - Enhanced Autopilot/whatever watered-down version of FSD my HW4 car is currently running is barely better than a joke. In its current form, it's not any better (and in some ways is worse) then driving aids that have been available on mainstream automakers' cars for 4 or 5 years now. I know Tesla's continuing to invest heavily in development, and I am open to re-evaluating when the newest version becomes available for my car. But right now, I can't believe people pay extra for this.\n> - The parking aid/\"sensor\" functionality is also a joke, which I have ranted about in other threads. It's constantly off by multiple _feet_ and the car's interpretation of its environment is sketchy at best. Probably the worst instance was when it freaked out because it thought I was going to hit...a painted white line on the pavement.\n> - Trip/charging planning isn't as powerful/flexible as I'd like it to be. You've got to do a fair amount of mental math and/or fiddle with third party tools like ABRP to make sure you can align desired arrival time _and_ arrival state of charge (which is buggy when it comes to setting target departure/arrival times).\n> - Supercharging is expensive. Pretty much as expensive as gas, but is less convenient and takes longer.\n> - Ride is on the firm side, too \"busy\" on certain surfaces\n> - No cooled seats ![🥵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f975.png)\n>\n> I think that about sums it up! I may revisit/post an update after I've spent longer with the car. Like I said, I always found personal reviews interesting, especially as people adapted to an EV and thought about things they hadn't had to consider before (like in terms of planning roadtrips and stuff like that). So I hope this helps somebody.\n>\n> Obligatory picture (pre-tint):\n>\n> [View attachment 967345](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/967345/)\n>\n> Click to expand...\n\nThank you, that was an awesome review; The main reason why I purchased an MYP was speed, performance, HP, and just like you mentioned; When driving with my wife, she will not allow me to go fast ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png)![🤣](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png) Have taken a few trips from Anaheim to Chandler AZ and honestly it’s not fun.\n\nCan’t beat the fun around town and short trips, but hate being controlled how fast I can drive and stops I Must make, drives me crazy.

It does mean some more charging time, but that can put your SoC lower at the charger which means that the extra charging will be at fast speed. Also, driving faster will make your battery warmer, so less likely to need preconditioning.\n\n> So that was an experience.

Everyone around here says \"just set the destination and stop where it tells you\"...well, yeah that will get you there, but if you need to be charged when you arrive _and_ you're trying to arrive by a certain time...now you've got to think about longer/additional charging stops, the charging curve...things get more complicated. PLEASE Tesla, add an optional \"State of charge at destination\" parameter to route planning. This one addition, which could show the total travel time after accounting for a longer charging stop (and the associated charging curve), would be a huge quality of life upgrade.\n>\n>\n> Click to expand...\n\nSoC at destination seems an obvious setting.

I just finished the first road trip with mine so I decided to write one up.\n>\n> ### **Background** ​\n>\n> My background (because I think that's important context when someone's judging something): I'm a software architect and sometime-entrepreneur who is also a car nerd. I follow the car industry _very_ closely and ~~probably~~ definitely drive people nuts because I am fascinated by the little details of how cars are designed and built...I've been a fan of Doug DeMuro's for years because I similarly love all the little quirks designed into cars and am always interested to learn the history/\"why\" something is designed a certain way. Even before Tesla showed up with their new way of doing automotive software, I would talk the ear off anyone who would listen about how car makers needed to modernize their approach to software. I used to fill notebooks with car drawings as a kid. I do autocross racing. My useless skill is that I can identify nearly any car built since the mid-1980s just by its headlight design. I've owned Dodge, Ford, VW, Honda, Kia, Acura, Lexus, BMW. And driven many more besides.\n>\n> Why did I choose a Tesla? A combination of (1) the aforementioned software contributing to a better/slicker user experience, (2) styling suits me (both outside and in...mostly), and (3) value. I'd been eyeing an EV for a few years, and when Tesla dropped prices, plus the federal tax credit, plus my BMW 340i was starting to have electrical...gremlins...that no one could hunt down (German car tax), I decided it was time. In an ideal world I would have bought a Model S, but I just couldn't find an additional $45k+ of car there over the Model Y to justify it to myself.\n>\n> Why a Performance model? Because...uh...zoom zoom? ![🙃](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f643.png) My wife, however, has banned me from flooring it while she's in the car...it's too violent for her (would hate to see her in an MS Plaid). It's not our primary roadtrip vehicle so I'm not too concerned about maximizing range most of the time. And I tend to buy go-fast cars. So I ordered a Performance in Midnight Blue Metallic with a white interior and the tow hitch. No FSD. Ordered July 25, delivered Aug 12.\n>\n> ### Initial Impressions​\n>\n> Delivery was fast and easy — love doing everything in the app. Fit and finish was pretty good, just a few very tiny chips in the front bumper (can hardly even see them unless you really stick your face in) and that was pretty much it. The local delivery center did a poor job prepping it though — polishing compound was everywhere and there was still sticky residue from shipping material on the bumpers.\n>\n> I will say, the paint quality is atrocious — the worst I've ever seen on any car I've owned. Splotches/weird spots under the clearcoat everywhere, scratches, a few nibs, even what appears to be a slight \"undersprayed\" area on the hatch (like it didn't quite get enough paint). Unlikely that anyone will ever notice it, and I'm not willing to risk them making it worse by repainting, but still it's disappointing. Truly terribly paint quality. My mid-90s Dodge — truly a paragon of quality manufacturing — had way better paint than this Tesla. I'm a reasonably good DIY detailer, but even after I did clay bar, a two-stage polish, and ceramic...the paint is just okay at best.\n>\n> As for the car in general, it's pretty much everything I hoped it would be — quiet, fast, good-looking, slick tech (mostly), pretty good sound system, good UX on everything from walk-away-locking to the charging experience. Spacious (especially compared to my snug 3 series). Tons of storage for the footprint. The minimalist interior suits me — I'm a bit of a minimalist where possible in my life, I like things with clean lines and not cluttered, so for the most part the interior works for me. But I _do_ wish there was a HUD with at least some basic info (speed, turn signals). And ventilated seats. Really, really wish there was ventilated seats. It's hitting 107 heat index here this week in the midwest. I wish for that even more than CarPlay.\n>\n> The ride in the Performance, while firm, is better than I expected (I didn't get a chance to do an extended test drive in a Performance because the Indianapolis Tesla center doesn't offer them for test drives — I just got to spend 5 minutes in a neighbors'). It's firm, but solid and (mostly) planted feeling. Many types of imperfections are reasonably well damped. It's over smaller imperfections that they still have some work to do...and when there's lots of small imperfections in a row, it does feel too busy. Drive this thing on a brick road like I did in East Grand Rapids and it sucks. But overall pretty good. I'll probably upsize the tire width when it's time to replace them and get a little bit more compliance out of a less-stretched sidewall.\n>\n> And of course it's stupid fast for a midsize crossover. The kids think it's hilarious. It's terrifying to think of teenagers driving these things. I was hooligan when I was 18 and borrowed my neighbor's BMW 540i for prom...and that thing was nowhere near as fast as a base Tesla these days, let alone a Performance model.\n>\n> ### The Roadtrip — charging and Autopilot experiences​\n>\n> On the 6th day of ownership, I took it on a 230ish mile (each way) road trip from Indianapolis to the Holland/Grand Rapids, MI area. Up on a Friday, back on Saturday. This was my first trip in an EV. I used the Tessie app to schedule an automation that changed the charge limit to 100% at about 5 am (from 80%), which got the car charged up to 100% before I left at 9am using my Tesla Wall Charger I installed in the garage.\n>\n> The route, using the \"Drives\" I did over those two days mapped in Tessie:\n>\n> [View attachment 967337](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/967337/)\n>\n> I wanted to show a version of that map with the Superchargers that I used marked, but the charging map view in Tessie doesn't seem to be working.\n>\n> #### Autopilot..ish​\n>\n> On the way, I tried out whatever flavor of Enhanced Autopilot/FSD I have on free trial (it's a HW4 car, so I don't have the latest FSD Beta, as far as I know)...I hang out on this forum too much and I still don't know what version of this service I technically have right now. Anyway, I turned on all the Autopilot options I could, and tried to use it. Observations from the trip:\n>\n> - A couple of times, it aborted a lane change (initiated by me with the turn signal stalk) halfway through...the car swerved and canceled for no apparent reason. Alarming.\n> - Car's perception of things’ distance is jerky (like trucks) — is that truck next to me 5 feet away or 10 feet away? Dancing around on the screen.\n> - Couldn’t handle some of the construction lane shifts even though they were clearly marked with both cones/barrels and fresh paint. Some it did OK.\n> - Sometimes rode too close to the left line of my lane, close enough that I could tell the car next to me was feeling a little crowded.\n> - The attention nagger (apply force to the wheel) seemed _totally random_. Sometimes it would nag less than 5 seconds after I engaged Autopilot, sometimes it would go nearly a minute with me not touching the wheel and it wouldn't do anything. On that note, this is annoying...a capacitive sensor would be way nicer, just to know my hand is on the wheel, instead of having to apply force to it.\n> - The car would brake/slow down for yellow flashing intersection caution lights on US 31...far too much. It was dangerous because no one behind me is expecting me to slow down, and the car would decelerate quite suddenly (because it wouldn't \"see\" the lights until they were pretty close, relatively speaking, at 70mph). And then it seemed unsure if they were yellow or red lights sometimes.\n> - There was one spot the car was convinced there was a traffic signal and slowed down, where there hadn't been a traffic signal for a year (it is being converted to an overpass). And this is on the main north-south route through Indiana, not some side road.\n> - It was too slow to accelerate back up to the set speed after slowing down (because of a car in my lane or whatever). This resulted in me sitting in the left lane, _very_ gradually coming back up to speed after another car had moved over, and irritating the people behind me. And this is the midwest, where drivers aren't anywhere near as aggressive as they are in many coastal cities.\n>\n> All in all, it was pretty disappointing. Other than being able to do lane changes when I signaled, it was no really better than the driving aids in our 2021 Kia Telluride. And in some ways worse (for example, the Telluride doesn't slam on its brakes when I get near yellow flashing intersection lights on the highway). It was _not_ relaxing.\n>\n> #### Charging​\n>\n> On the way up, I drove around 70 mph for a lot of the trip. I made it to the Superchargers at Meijer in Holland, 221 miles, without stopping (it would turn out every charging stop on this trip was at a Meijer, by coincidence), and with about 12% remaining on the battery. So extrapolating, that would suggest a 255 mile range with the driving conditions that day. Not bad.\n>\n> When I arrived at my first charging stop (which was also near my destination), it was about lunch time, and I knew I was going to want plenty of charge for the around-town driving I was going to be doing the rest of the day in Holland, plus I needed to drive 30 miles to Grand Rapids for the night. So I let the car charge from 12 to 99% while I got some lunch and killed a little time. This took 1 hour and 2 minutes, and cost $28.86. I was a little surprised at how much it cost. That was actually about the same amount I would have spent on gas to go 230 miles in my turbocharged BMW which got around 34 mpg on the highway and drank $4/gal premium. And only a few $ less than what it would cost to cover the same distance in our big three-row Telluride that gets around 24 mpg at highway speeds.\n>\n> Did my thing, stayed overnight at a friend's (didn't bother to plug the car in at their house, it would have been a 110V outlet). Overnight the battery dropped 3% because I left Sentry mode on (and maybe also because it got a bit cool that night? Around 50F). Given what happened the next day with time constraints, in hindsight I should have asked him for an extension cord and plugged it in.\n>\n> On the way home, I was a bit rushed because I had to be back home by 3:15pm at the absolute latest and didn't get out the door in Grand Rapids until about 10:40am. Normally a 4 hour drive, in a gas car that would put me home around 2:40pm. I knew I'd have to charge, but I didn't completely mentally build in enough fudge factor for the reality that the charging stations were not optimally placed for me to only charge at a low state of charge — thus my charging speed would be slower. PLUS, I needed to get home with a certain amount of charge because I had to run errands after getting back.\n>\n> On this route, there's a Supercharger \"void\" of 125 miles between Benton Harbor, MI, and Kokomo, IN (unless you really want to detour far off to the other side of South Bend instead of skirting around the west side it). This really limits your charging options.\n>\n> Summary of the drive:\n>\n> - Leave Grand Rapids at 74%\n> - Stop to charge in Benton Harbor (at a Meijer) at 35% -> charge to 76% (18 minutes, $12.87). This was as far as I could go, I wasn't going to make it to the next Supercharger otherwise.\n> - Realize that if I drive slowly (65-70) I can make it home, but won't arrive with enough charge to run errands. So I'm going to have to stop to charge again, which will take time...which means I need to drive faster (80), so now I _definitely_ need to charge because driving faster is less efficient, which means I'll need to charge even _more_ to make up for driving faster. Weird damned-if-you-do/don't situation.\n> - Stop in Kokomo to charge (also at a Meijer), 22% -> 55% (10 minutes, $10.73)\n> - Arrived home at 3:07pm with 30% SoC, enough to run my errands for the rest of the day and finish the day around 14%.\n>\n> Every Supercharger I used was a 250kW, by the way.\n>\n> So that was an experience. And I learned I have to do my own math or augment Tesla's route planning with something like A Better Route Planner (which I don't like because it's buggy) if I have to arrive with a certain state of charge. Everyone around here says \"just set the destination and stop where it tells you\"...well, yeah that will get you there, but if you need to be charged when you arrive _and_ you're trying to arrive by a certain time...now you've got to think about longer/additional charging stops, the charging curve...things get more complicated. PLEASE Tesla, add an optional \"State of charge at destination\" parameter to route planning. This one addition, which could show the total travel time after accounting for a longer charging stop (and the associated charging curve), would be a huge quality of life upgrade.\n>\n> ### Summary: Pros and Cons​\n>\n> ### Pros​\n>\n> - The car feels great to drive. Smooth, powerful, handles reasonably well for what it is.\n> - Love the ability to remote start the climate from my Apple Watch (using Tessie) from inside a store on a hot day.\n> - It was very comfortable for the 4+ hour road trip. Seats were great. It was quiet. Music streaming and bluetooth via my phone of audiobooks worked effortlessly.\n> - I am happy every time I get in it. The whole user experience is pretty good — removing little pieces of friction like having to lock/unlock, press a start button, turn the car off, the fact that _everything_ from the driving settings to the vent position is tied with my driver profile...it all adds up to an easy/seamless experience.\n> - I no longer feel guilty if I need to talk a very short trip in the Tesla vs firing up a gas car. We live in a small suburb's downtown area, it's mostly walkable where nearly everything is within a mile or two of our house...but certain stores, while very close distance-wise, are not that walkable because you have to cross 5 lanes of traffic or it's just a little too far to want to walk when it's really hot.\n>\n> ### Cons​\n>\n> - Enhanced Autopilot/whatever watered-down version of FSD my HW4 car is currently running is barely better than a joke. In its current form, it's not any better (and in some ways is worse) then driving aids that have been available on mainstream automakers' cars for 4 or 5 years now. I know Tesla's continuing to invest heavily in development, and I am open to re-evaluating when the newest version becomes available for my car. But right now, I can't believe people pay extra for this.\n> - The parking aid/\"sensor\" functionality is also a joke, which I have ranted about in other threads. It's constantly off by multiple _feet_ and the car's interpretation of its environment is sketchy at best. Probably the worst instance was when it freaked out because it thought I was going to hit...a painted white line on the pavement.\n> - Trip/charging planning isn't as powerful/flexible as I'd like it to be. You've got to do a fair amount of mental math and/or fiddle with third party tools like ABRP to make sure you can align desired arrival time _and_ arrival state of charge (which is buggy when it comes to setting target departure/arrival times).\n> - Supercharging is expensive. Pretty much as expensive as gas, but is less convenient and takes longer.\n> - Ride is on the firm side, too \"busy\" on certain surfaces\n> - No cooled seats ![🥵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f975.png)\n>\n> I think that about sums it up! I may revisit/post an update after I've spent longer with the car. Like I said, I always found personal reviews interesting, especially as people adapted to an EV and thought about things they hadn't had to consider before (like in terms of planning roadtrips and stuff like that).

On that note, this is annoying...a capacitive sensor would be way nicer, just to know my hand is on the wheel, instead of having to apply force to it.\n> - The car would brake/slow down for yellow flashing intersection caution lights on US 31...far too much. It was dangerous because no one behind me is expecting me to slow down, and the car would decelerate quite suddenly (because it wouldn't \"see\" the lights until they were pretty close, relatively speaking, at 70mph). And then it seemed unsure if they were yellow or red lights sometimes.\n> - There was one spot the car was convinced there was a traffic signal and slowed down, where there hadn't been a traffic signal for a year (it is being converted to an overpass). And this is on the main north-south route through Indiana, not some side road.\n> - It was too slow to accelerate back up to the set speed after slowing down (because of a car in my lane or whatever). This resulted in me sitting in the left lane, _very_ gradually coming back up to speed after another car had moved over, and irritating the people behind me. And this is the midwest, where drivers aren't anywhere near as aggressive as they are in many coastal cities.\n>\n> All in all, it was pretty disappointing. Other than being able to do lane changes when I signaled, it was no really better than the driving aids in our 2021 Kia Telluride. And in some ways worse (for example, the Telluride doesn't slam on its brakes when I get near yellow flashing intersection lights on the highway). It was _not_ relaxing.\n>\n> #### Charging​\n>\n> On the way up, I drove around 70 mph for a lot of the trip. I made it to the Superchargers at Meijer in Holland, 221 miles, without stopping (it would turn out every charging stop on this trip was at a Meijer, by coincidence), and with about 12% remaining on the battery. So extrapolating, that would suggest a 255 mile range with the driving conditions that day. Not bad.\n>\n> When I arrived at my first charging stop (which was also near my destination), it was about lunch time, and I knew I was going to want plenty of charge for the around-town driving I was going to be doing the rest of the day in Holland, plus I needed to drive 30 miles to Grand Rapids for the night. So I let the car charge from 12 to 99% while I got some lunch and killed a little time. This took 1 hour and 2 minutes, and cost $28.86. I was a little surprised at how much it cost. That was actually about the same amount I would have spent on gas to go 230 miles in my turbocharged BMW which got around 34 mpg on the highway and drank $4/gal premium. And only a few $ less than what it would cost to cover the same distance in our big three-row Telluride that gets around 24 mpg at highway speeds.\n>\n> Did my thing, stayed overnight at a friend's (didn't bother to plug the car in at their house, it would have been a 110V outlet). Overnight the battery dropped 3% because I left Sentry mode on (and maybe also because it got a bit cool that night? Around 50F). Given what happened the next day with time constraints, in hindsight I should have asked him for an extension cord and plugged it in.\n>\n> On the way home, I was a bit rushed because I had to be back home by 3:15pm at the absolute latest and didn't get out the door in Grand Rapids until about 10:40am. Normally a 4 hour drive, in a gas car that would put me home around 2:40pm. I knew I'd have to charge, but I didn't completely mentally build in enough fudge factor for the reality that the charging stations were not optimally placed for me to only charge at a low state of charge — thus my charging speed would be slower. PLUS, I needed to get home with a certain amount of charge because I had to run errands after getting back.\n>\n> On this route, there's a Supercharger \"void\" of 125 miles between Benton Harbor, MI, and Kokomo, IN (unless you really want to detour far off to the other side of South Bend instead of skirting around the west side it). This really limits your charging options.\n>\n> Summary of the drive:\n>\n> - Leave Grand Rapids at 74%\n> - Stop to charge in Benton Harbor (at a Meijer) at 35% -> charge to 76% (18 minutes, $12.87). This was as far as I could go, I wasn't going to make it to the next Supercharger otherwise.\n> - Realize that if I drive slowly (65-70) I can make it home, but won't arrive with enough charge to run errands. So I'm going to have to stop to charge again, which will take time...which means I need to drive faster (80), so now I _definitely_ need to charge because driving faster is less efficient, which means I'll need to charge even _more_ to make up for driving faster. Weird damned-if-you-do/don't situation.\n> - Stop in Kokomo to charge (also at a Meijer), 22% -> 55% (10 minutes, $10.73)\n> - Arrived home at 3:07pm with 30% SoC, enough to run my errands for the rest of the day and finish the day around 14%.\n>\n> Every Supercharger I used was a 250kW, by the way.\n>\n> So that was an experience. And I learned I have to do my own math or augment Tesla's route planning with something like A Better Route Planner (which I don't like because it's buggy) if I have to arrive with a certain state of charge. Everyone around here says \"just set the destination and stop where it tells you\"...well, yeah that will get you there, but if you need to be charged when you arrive _and_ you're trying to arrive by a certain time...now you've got to think about longer/additional charging stops, the charging curve...things get more complicated. PLEASE Tesla, add an optional \"State of charge at destination\" parameter to route planning. This one addition, which could show the total travel time after accounting for a longer charging stop (and the associated charging curve), would be a huge quality of life upgrade.\n>\n> ### Summary: Pros and Cons​\n>\n> ### Pros​\n>\n> - The car feels great to drive. Smooth, powerful, handles reasonably well for what it is.\n> - Love the ability to remote start the climate from my Apple Watch (using Tessie) from inside a store on a hot day.\n> - It was very comfortable for the 4+ hour road trip. Seats were great. It was quiet. Music streaming and bluetooth via my phone of audiobooks worked effortlessly.\n> - I am happy every time I get in it. The whole user experience is pretty good — removing little pieces of friction like having to lock/unlock, press a start button, turn the car off, the fact that _everything_ from the driving settings to the vent position is tied with my driver profile...it all adds up to an easy/seamless experience.\n> - I no longer feel guilty if I need to talk a very short trip in the Tesla vs firing up a gas car. We live in a small suburb's downtown area, it's mostly walkable where nearly everything is within a mile or two of our house...but certain stores, while very close distance-wise, are not that walkable because you have to cross 5 lanes of traffic or it's just a little too far to want to walk when it's really hot.\n>\n> ### Cons​\n>\n> - Enhanced Autopilot/whatever watered-down version of FSD my HW4 car is currently running is barely better than a joke. In its current form, it's not any better (and in some ways is worse) then driving aids that have been available on mainstream automakers' cars for 4 or 5 years now. I know Tesla's continuing to invest heavily in development, and I am open to re-evaluating when the newest version becomes available for my car. But right now, I can't believe people pay extra for this.\n> - The parking aid/\"sensor\" functionality is also a joke, which I have ranted about in other threads. It's constantly off by multiple _feet_ and the car's interpretation of its environment is sketchy at best. Probably the worst instance was when it freaked out because it thought I was going to hit...a painted white line on the pavement.\n> - Trip/charging planning isn't as powerful/flexible as I'd like it to be. You've got to do a fair amount of mental math and/or fiddle with third party tools like ABRP to make sure you can align desired arrival time _and_ arrival state of charge (which is buggy when it comes to setting target departure/arrival times).\n> - Supercharging is expensive. Pretty much as expensive as gas, but is less convenient and takes longer.\n> - Ride is on the firm side, too \"busy\" on certain surfaces\n> - No cooled seats ![🥵](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f975.png)\n>\n> I think that about sums it up! I may revisit/post an update after I've spent longer with the car. Like I said, I always found personal reviews interesting, especially as people adapted to an EV and thought about things they hadn't had to consider before (like in terms of planning roadtrips and stuff like that). So I hope this helps somebody.\n>\n> Obligatory picture (pre-tint):\n>\n> [View attachment 967345](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/967345/)\n>\n> Click to expand...\n\nNice picture, but those are 21’ Uberturbines , before you swapped them to 19’s and long trip![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)\n\n[![rogersmj](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/data/avatars/h/285/285043.jpg?1694046774)](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/rogersmj.285043/)\n\n#### [rogersmj](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/members/rogersmj.285043/)\n\n##### Member\n\nJul 1, 2023[154](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/search/member?user_id=285043)239[Indianapolis](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/misc/location-info?location=Indianapolis)\n\n> [Msicario said:](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/goto/post?id=7782816)\n>\n> Nice picture, but those are 21’ Uberturbines , before you swapped them to 19’s and long trip![🤔](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png)\n>\n> Click to expand...\n\nHuh?

we talk about you-know-who? Actually, let’s not. Whatever you think of the company’s figurehead, the **Tesla Model Y** is an influential car that has topped a bunch of best-seller lists over the past few years. When such a significant car gets a major update, we’re curious what it’s like, and we assume you are too.\n\nThe [Model Y has been around since 2021](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/model-y-2022-2024) (2020 in the US). It getting facelifted after five years could almost make you believe that [Tesla](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla) is a normal car company. The car’s had various updates to its battery and specification in smaller model year updates, but this is the one that you can actually see. The headline news of the Model Y ‘Juniper’ are the styling changes and some comfort upgrades.\n\nFinance Your Next Car \\| Drivenfi\n\n## Finance   Your Next Car With\n\n![Drivenfi](https://drivenbuy.co.uk/img/drivenfi-logo-light.png)\n\nCar Price\n(£)\n\nDeposit\n(£)\n\nTerm (In\nMonths)12243648\n\nMonthly Payment:\n\n£194.33\n\nRepresentative Rate:\n\n11.9%\nAPR\n\nBalloon Payment:\n\n£4,629.00\n\nInteractive\nPCP\ncalculator,\ninsert your\nown numbers to suit you.\n\n\nDrivenfi: Authorised and regulated by the Financial\nConduct\nAuthority (FRN\n994564), we are a\ncredit broker, not a lender. \\*Eligibility is subject to status, terms & conditions apply.\nExample price based on market value of used vehicle displayed in image within 4 years of age\nwith under 30,000 miles.\n\n\n## Finance   Your Next Car With\n\n![Drivenfi](https://drivenbuy.co.uk/img/drivenfi-logo-light.png)\n\nReset\nCalculator [Get\\\\\nQuote\\\\\nNow](https://drivenbuy.co.uk/autocar?car_make=tesla&car_model=model-y&review=new&source=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/model-y#)\n\nVerdict\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review front action blur 9295](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/thumbnail/public/tesla-model-y-2025-review-front-action-blur_9295.jpg?itok=Le944Ko4)\n\nModel tested:\n\nRating:\n\n## Tesla Model Y\n\nStill cavernous, efficient and quick. Now at least 30% less annoying.\n\nGood\n\nExcellent efficiency and resulting range\n\nHuge boot\n\nFacelift brings numerous quality-of-life upgrades\n\nBad\n\nDivisive interior lay-out\n\nRide and handling are fine rather than standout\n\n## DESIGN & STYLING\n\nPros\n\nSharper looks\n\nrelatively lightweight\n\nChanges address common criticisms\n\nPowerful\n\nCons\n\nBrand comes with a few connotations\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review rear corner 9289](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-y-2025-review-rear-corner_9289.jpg)\n\nAt the front, there’s a [Cybertruck](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/cybertruck)-inspired light bar, with the main headlights moving to separate units underneath, while at the rear, the previously quite rounded tailgate becomes more angular. There’s a new light bar using indirect light, and a slightly more pronounced spoiler lip. Apparently, this produces some more downforce to keep the car planted despite the softer suspension.\n\nThat’s the other headline change: in response to criticism from anyone who’s ever driven a Model Y, the suspension has been made more compliant, the steering less hyperactive and there’s better noise insulation with acoustic glass.\n\n> You still get aerodynamic 19in wheels as standard. The 20in items in the photos are a £2100 option\n>\n> [Illya Verpraet\\\\\n> \\\\\n> Road Tester](https://www.autocar.co.uk/users/illya-verpraet)\n\nThere are no notable powertrain changes, although Tesla does claim to have made the car slightly more efficient by way of improved aero. There are still two battery packs: a 63kWh LFP unit, and an 83kWh NMC one. The Standard Range car comes exclusively with a single 279bhp rear motor; the Long-Range version comes either a 308bhp rear motor, or dual motors producing 375bhp. Annoyingly, Tesla doesn’t quote power figures or battery sizes, so these are the generally accepted figures rather than official ones.\n\nThe Model Y continues to use a mix of steel and aluminium for its structure, including a few very large castings. Tesla seems to be the only manufacturer who can keep the weight of its electric family SUV under two tonnes (albeit only just). New reinforcements and various hidden design changes are said to have increased the torsional rigidity. Suspension is by double wishbones up front and a multi-link at the rear. Originally, all right-hand drive Model Ys were made in Shanghai, but for the last few years, all European-market cars have been made in Berlin.\n\n## INTERIOR\n\nPros\n\nGood rear seat space\n\nenormous boot, plus frunk\n\nScreen works quickly and logically\n\nCons\n\nSparse design with next to no physical controls\n\nno dedicated driver display\n\nNo CarPlay or Android Auto\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review dash 9268](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-y-2025-review-dash_9268.jpg)\n\nWhile most carmakers are on a mission to strip complexity out of their interiors, Tesla is slowly adding extra stuff in. Don’t get your hopes up: it’s still minimalist to the extreme, with essentially no buttons, but the materials have had a bit of an upgrade, the centre console has gained some flexibility and ambient lighting has appeared.\n\nObviously, the style still isn’t to all tastes, but it somehow doesn’t look as generic as some of the Chinese contenders, and palate of materials and colours is quite cohesive. Even the door bins are soft-touch and carpeted, which isn’t the case on some much more expensive cars.\n\n> The seats are set quite high in a Model Y, to create foot space for rear passengers. It doesn’t create a sporting driving position, but in combination with the low scuttle and windows, and high roof, it creates quite an airy feeling.\n>\n> [Illya Verpraet\\\\\n> \\\\\n> Road Tester](https://www.autocar.co.uk/users/illya-verpraet)\n\nThe British Leyland level build quality that Tesla became known for at one point is long gone, but a loose trim piece in the headliner of our test car still caused a few squeaks.\n\nThe centre touchscreen is mostly familiar. As all-screen interfaces go, it doesn’t get much better: it’s extremely clear, logical and responsive, with important functions just one press away.\n\nThe lack of [Apple CarPlay](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-apple-carplay-and-how-does-it-work) and [Android Auto](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/what-android-auto) is annoying, but over the years Tesla has expanded its library of third-party apps. As well as Spotify, there’s built-in Apple Music and Podcasts, Tidal, etc, so it’s not the problem that it could be.\n\nTesla’s upgrade efforts don’t extend to a dedicated driver’s display, which will be a problem for some. I quite like the clear view ahead that this gives, and all your important information is very clear. I just wish that a third of the screen wasn’t dedicated to the ADAS display, which shows you what the car can see. “Well done; you can tell an artic from a traffic cone. Now show me something actually useful”.\n\nIn the back, the big news is the addition of a small touchscreen, which means that rear passengers no longer need to ask the front occupants to turn on the heated seats. The screen also does media, YouTube and the like.\n\nThe Model Y doesn’t have class-leading knee- or headroom, but they’re good enough, and because the bench is set fairly high, the seating position is comfortable. The backrest can now also recline electrically.\n\nIt’s with storage space where the Model Y blows away the competition. The boot is enormous by itself, and that’s before you count the underfloor storage and the big frunk. You can drop the rear seatbacks electronically. A parcel shelf is standard (unlike on early Model Ys), but the way it folds feels home-made. We’d expect a roller cover here.\n\n## ENGINES & PERFORMANCE\n\nPros\n\nFast\n\nSmooth traction/stability control\n\nSmooth regen\n\nCons\n\nNo freewheeling regen mode\n\nJumpy accelerator in Sport mode\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review front corner 9282](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-y-2025-review-front-corner_9282.jpg)\n\nWe’ve so far only driven the Long Range AWD, which is very fast indeed. Unless you absolutely need four-wheel drive, we’d always go for the single motor.\n\nTesla tends to tune its cars in such a way that they remind you at all times of their performance potential. In other words, the accelerator can feel quite jumpy. I prefer to drive the Model Y in ‘Chill’ mode, which softens off the response, but that also limits power, even if you floor it.\n\nOne lesser-reported change that makes a big difference is the addition of brake-by-wire. Tesla used to be one of the only EV makers that didn’t have a blended brake pedal. Instead, you got very heavy one-pedal driving while the brake pedal just did acted on the discs.\n\nThe signature one-pedal drive mode is still the default, but you now have the option of a gentler setting, which lets you control most of the regen with the brake pedal. This makes it much easier to drive smoothly.\n\n## RIDE & HANDLING\n\nPros\n\nGrip and balance\n\ngood visibility\n\nunintrusive ADAS\n\nCons\n\nStill fairly firm and noisy, despite updates\n\nSteering takes some getting used to\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review interior driving 9278](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-y-2025-review-interior-driving_9278.jpg)\n\nThe new Model Y still feels fundamentally Tesla-like to drive, but better in every way to what I remember from the early Model Ys.\n\nDespite the suspension changes, it’s still on the firmer, noisier end of the spectrum, but the worst edges have definitely been taken off. The ride is very firm and connected, but less so than before, and rounds off sharper intrusions fairly well. Similarly, the level of road noise is now nothing remarkable – in a positive or negative sense.\n\nWhile the steering has been slowed down from 2 to 2.4 turns lock to lock, it remains darty off-centre, but with rather remote feel. The treacly feel has vanished; instead the weighting can be slightly inconsistent. Add in the relative lack of body roll, and from your elevated driving position, the Model Y feel tippy rather than planted.\n\nWith the battery pack in the floor, it’s perfectly stable of course, and there’s plenty of grip, and a bit of rear bias to the power delivery, so you can easily make progress on a twisty road. You wouldn’t do so for the fun of it.\n\nAll Model Ys come with ‘Autopilot’ as standard. You can upgrade to ‘enhanced autopilot’ and ‘full-self driving capability’ for rather a lot of money. In Europe and the UK, where there’s stricter regulation of that sort of thing than in the US, we wouldn’t bother, because the differences are minor.\n\nAs a conventional adaptive cruise control system with lane following, Autopilot is okay. It’s smooth enough, but a bit slow to accelerate. Autosteer can only be enabled while stationary, and then always comes on when you engage the cruise control.\n\nOtherwise, the ADAS features are relatively unintrusive. The lane keep assist is quite mild, and I suspect the overspeed warning just wasn’t working on the test car. Even if it was, it would be easy to disable.\n\n## MPG & RUNNING COSTS\n\nPros\n\nWell-priced compared with high-spec rivals\n\nStrong efficiency results in very good range\n\nintegration of supercharger network into navigation\n\nCons\n\nNo entry level versions with lower spec\n\nOptional paint colours are very expensive\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review front action blur 9295](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-y-2025-review-front-action-blur_9295.jpg)\n\nDespite all the advances of other manufacturers, Tesla is still ahead when it comes to EV tech. It averaged 3.8mpkWh after a mixed day of driving. Okay, conditions were ideal, but that’s still impressive and would make for about 300 real-world miles – considerably more than you’d get from a [Hyundai Ioniq 5](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/hyundai/ioniq-5). You’d likely get even more from the Long-Range RWD.\n\nSave for a paint colour and some bigger wheels, all Teslas come fully-loaded, so while the Model Y looks expensive compared to the base versions of rival models, there’s little in it compared to high-spec alternatives, and the monthly rates are looking quite attractive too.\n\n> There aren't many options with a Tesla, but the ones there are, are very expensive. Red paint is £2600\n>\n> [Illya Verpraet\\\\\n> \\\\\n> Road Tester](https://www.autocar.co.uk/users/illya-verpraet)\n\nWe’ve yet to do a DC charging test on this car to verify how long it holds its 250kW peak speed. From previous experience, Teslas are no longer the fastest-charging EVs on the market, but very competitive nonetheless.\n\nThe Supercharger network is no longer the trump card it used to be now that cars from other makers can use some of them. Some remain Tesla-exclusive, though, and a Tesla’s navigation is still plugged into live info about which superchargers are busy or out of service in a way that others’ aren’t. As a result, Tesla’s EV route planning is still second to none.\n\n## VERDICT\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review rear action blur 9293](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/tesla-model-y-2025-review-rear-action-blur_9293.jpg)\n\nVerdict\n\n![Tesla Model Y 2025 Review front action blur 9295](https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/thumbnail/public/tesla-model-y-2025-review-front-action-blur_9295.jpg?itok=Le944Ko4)\n\nModel tested:\n\nRating:\n\n## Tesla Model Y\n\nStill cavernous, efficient and quick. Now at least 30% less annoying.\n\nGood\n\nExcellent efficiency and resulting range\n\nHuge boot\n\nFacelift brings numerous quality-of-life upgrades\n\nBad\n\nDivisive interior lay-out\n\nRide and handling are fine rather than standout\n\nFor all the hype and love-hate culture around the Tesla brand, a Model Y is really a car you buy with your head rather than your heart. Apart from being fast, it’s merely fine to drive. Some rivals are more comfortable, handle more naturally and give you more options for regenerative braking. The interior’s quite plain but hard to fault for functionality.\n\nWhat the Model Y is brilliant at is the sensible stuff. It has all the rear-seat space you probably need, and even more luggage room. It also outdoes all rivals for energy efficiency and range. That all applied to the outgoing one, but this new one adds a bunch of useful new features, improves the driveability and takes the edge off the ride.
